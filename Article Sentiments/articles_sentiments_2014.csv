On Twitter, the company's CEO Patrick Byrne said the retailer saw $130K worth of Bitcoin orders on the first day.Byrne went on CNN International to talk about his company's Bitcoin acceptance and made a couple points that are worth noting.One is that the company immediately swaps out its Bitcoins back to US Dollars once the transaction is complete. Byrne says he's a Bitcoin believer, but until he has suppliers that accept Bitcoin, there's no reason to hold onto them. He'd also be interested in participating in a Bitcoin derivatives market at some point in the future to hedge against volatility.He also said he believes Amazon will be forced to accept Bitcoin at some point, as he claims the market is growing at 30% per month and that the company would be foolish to cede that market to others."", 'Bitcoin ATMs are coming to the city.Josh Harvey, co-founder of Lamassu, showed off the first bitcoin dispenser at last week’s Consumer Electronics Show and has found quite a bit of interest for the $5,000 machines.The machine, designed and manufactured in Portugal, looks like a typical deli ATM — but functions more like a vending machine. You put in US dollars and receive bitcoins back on your phone.Users first download a bitcoin wallet mobile app — such as BlockChain or Mycelium — and set a password.

They press the phone against the ATM’s glass window so it can scan the code, then feed in cash.Presto, the machine sends bitcoins to the phone.Brooklyn native Willard Ling, 30, is set to introduce the first bitcoin ATM to New York City.After scouting locations, he has chosen the East Village bubble tea shop Just Sweet, on 3rd Avenue and 12th Street.

At the very least, can I use it to satiate my huge and ever-present hunger?Thankfully yes, here are four of the best ways to eat with bitcoin.1. Eating on the streetIf, while walking around London’s Shoreditch area, you find yourself overcome with an animalistic yearning for a piece of meat hugged closely by two bits of bread, there are many restaurants and pubs to choose from.But if you’re flying the flag of the good ship bitcoin, there’s only one place for you: Burger Bear. Probably the first street vendor in the UK to accept bitcoin, Burger Bear serves artisanal burgers and has been taking bitcoin payments since late November. “The best burger in the world” is how one bitcoiner, Ryan Holder, described his purchase.In the US, Peruvian Brothers in Washington DC and Cheese Wizards in Seattle are leading the food truck industry’s acceptance of bitcoin. Fingers crossed more and more street vendors begin accepting bitcoin in 2014.2. Back to the farmThere’s nothing finer than fresh produce straight from the farm. Whether it be tasty peppers, glistening strawberries or just fresh greens, buying straight from the source always beats going to the supermarkets.If you are lucky enough to live in the Provo, Utah, the La Nay Ferme farm offers “naturally grown fruits and vegetables” you can buy with bitcoin. You can either join their CSA (community supported agriculture project), purchase a weekly share of their produce, or simply take your pick from their fresh selection each week.Down in Argentina, the Tierra Buena Network delivers organic farm produce to customers and welcomes bitcoiners with open arms.3. Don’t even leave the houseIf you’re the type of bitcoiner who’s inclined to order a takeaway instead of venturing beyond your front door (or, god-forbid, into the kitchen), there is also hope for you.Takeaway.com and many of the websites it owns in countries across the world now accept bitcoin for food deliveries.American bitcoiners probably have it easiest, with restaurant delivery network Foodler, which works with 12,000 restaurants, accepting bitcoins since April.Most of their purchases are in San Francisco and Washington DC. Although a future utopia where you can order any takeout you like with bitcoin isn’t fully realised yet, we’re getting there slowly.4. Survive the zombie apocalypseArtisanal burgers, fresh farm produce and home delivery are all great right now. But when the zombie apocalypse comes a-knocking, they’ll be little use to you (although a restaurant willing to battle the undead to bring hot curry to your front door would probably do good business in the apocalypse).When the day of judgement comes, you’ll want to make sure you’re prepared. That’s where SurvivalFood.com comes in. It accepts bitcoin and sells delights like the “Mountain House Turkey Tetrazzini Pouch” and the “Bandito Scramble Eggs Potatoes Breakfast Pouch”, both of which have a shelf life of seven years.So, if corpses begin bursting from their graves, you can rest easy knowing that bitcoin helped keep you fed and happy.Just don’t forget to lock your front door.Fridge, Fruit and Pizza Images via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', ""The emergence of innovative software and apps is transforming the way payments are made and the global commerce ecosystem. This is particularly evident when it comes to mobile and electronic payments, which are expected to grow at an annual rate of 59 percent and 18 percent respectively through 2014. And with global e-commerce transactions expected to increase from 29 billion in 2013 to 34 billion in 2014, there is an increasing need for secure and transparent global payment technology that focuses on consumer convenience and fraud prevention. Below are 12 companies which are making a significant impact on global commerce with innovative technology:StripeStripe offers a simple way for anyone to accept online payments without needing to code a fully functional payment system. In a matter of minutes, Stripe's easy-to-integrate plug and play solution makes it possible for any business to accept and manage online payments. From storing cards and processing transactions to making payments, Stripe offers everything needed to power online transactions. Leading companies including Squarespace, Zoho Books, Foursquare and Shopify, among others, use Stripe to power their marketplaces. The service, which recently launched in Europe, has raised over $40 million in funding and is estimated to be worth $500 million.CoinbaseCanvas is an international digital wallet, which lets anyone store, buy, use and accept a digital currency known as bitcoin. After connecting one’s bank account to the digital wallet, bitcoins can be bought and sold instantly and securely without any hassle. Coinbase also provides free payment processing to online businesses and vendors looking to add bitcoin to their online stores. Currently, Coinbase powers about 16,000 businesses, enabling them to manage all their bitcoin transactions in one place. Coinbase is seen to play a significant role in legitimizing digital currencies like bitcoin. Coinbase has raised over $30 million in funding.SquareSquare aims to make it easy to make payments to anyone from anywhere, using a host of features including the famous Square credit card reader for mobile devices. This card reader enables anyone with a smartphone to accept credit cards without hassle and with low transaction fees. In addition, Square offers a Square Wallet which allows consumers to pre-store credit card details for one step payments. It's now possible to transfer money to anyone via email using Square's newly launched Square Cash. The company, which was founded by Twitter's Jack Dorsey, recently closed a $200 million round of funding.VenmoVenmo is an Android and iOS app which makes it easy to transfer payments to friends for anything from rent and utilities to drinks and even birthday gifts. All payments made through Venmo are secured using sophisticated data encryption to prevent unauthorized transactions. There are also no transfer fees for payments, except for those from credit cards, which garner a three percent fee. The app is making money exchanges between friends easier, and due to its promise, was acquired by Braintree for over $20 million.FlintFlint is a mobile payments application which makes it possible for merchants to process credit and debit cards using a smartphone camera. The app empowers businesses with tools they need to handle transactions effectively outside the traditional retail environment, including issuing invoices and sending customers receipts. Customers also have the option to pay merchants using Flint with their mobile device instead of via check or bank transfer. Another novel feature available to merchants is the option to offer their customers in-app coupons at no extra charge. While the service does offer competitive rates, it doesn't accept AmEx and Discover. Flint has raised $8 million in funding.TipaltiTipalti is an automated global mass payment platform for making electronic payments to vendors in 190 countries without inconvenience or unnecessary charges. The Tipalti SaaS platform makes it easy for affiliate and advertising networks, crowdfunding platforms and all kinds of e-commerce businesses to make mass payments. Unlike other payment systems, Tipalti takes care of everything from payee registration and funds distribution to ensuring all tax and anti-terrorist regulations are met. In addition, the platform includes fraud management tools to keep payments safe, and comprehensive analytics to track all payments. Tipalti has processed payments to the value of $1 billion and has raised just over $3 million in funding.ZipmarkZipmark allows business owners to connect their U.S.-based checking accounts directly to other checking accounts for quick payments free of high charges and long waits typical of wire transfers, credit/debit payments and checks. The recipient only is charged 1 percent transaction fee, with a $5 maximum. The money is guaranteed to be transferred within one day, eliminating longer waits of PayPal and old-school checks. Zipmark also enables users to utilize QR codes to pay for anything from rent to fees or subscriptions.

01/19/2014,"['Three cities in Canada are set to have bitcoin ATMs installed in the coming weeks, making the country the top ATM location in the world. New ATMs will be installed in the Canadian capital city Ottawa as well as Montreal and financial hub Toronto.The ATM operators are announcing their plans to install machines across the country even as Canada\'s central bank issued a statement yesterday declaring bitcoin is not recognised as legal tender there.Fadi Azouz, who operates the Montreal machine, said his ATM would be installed by 24th January at the Bitcoin Embassy in Montreal. It will take live rates from either BitStamp or the Canadian exchange Virtex and will charge a 5% fee for transactions. The \'embassy\' is a non-profit organisation dedicated to promoting bitcoin. Azouz said the central bank\'s announcement would have no impact on his plans:""The [statement] does not affect us at all. As long as the millions of people using bitcoin around the world continue to believe in it and trust it to be an honest method of payment, it shall continue to [be] just that.""Azouz added that his company, Vx5 Technologies, will be installing and operating bitcoin ATMs in eight countries this year. They include Lebanon, the Philippines, Hungary and Venezuela, among others.Azouz will not be operating a Lamassu or Robocoin machine, which are the two most well known manufacturers of bitcoin ATMs at present. Instead, he has opted for a machine built by an Ottawa company called Bitaccess. The firm calls its machines \'BTMs\'.Bitaccess makes a machine that converts fiat currency to bitcoin and another model that does two-way conversions. Current players Lamassu and Robocoin offer machines that convert fiat to bitcoin or two-way conversions respectively.The Ottawa ATM maker has also included a wallet-generation feature on its machines. This means the ATM can create a wallet for a user who does not have an existing way of storing bitcoins. According to Bitaccess, a high-entropy, one-time, paper wallet is generated, which is then scanned manually by the user. The company says it doesn\'t store any information about the printed wallets.Ottawa will also get a Bitaccess machine, according to a report from the Ottawa Citizen. The machine will be operated by a company called BIT-Capital, which also claims to run several cryptocurrency investment funds. The Ottawa ATM was installed in the Clocktower Brew Pub yesterday, according to the Citizen\'s report. The micro-brewery boasts four home-brewed beers and an ""upscale pub menu"".Tom Drummond, a bitcoin user in Ottawa, said he welcomed the arrival of an ATM in the city. He said his current method of buying bitcoin on Canadian exchange Virtex takes between two hours and three days, depending on how he transfers his money to the exchange.Virtex charges a 1.5% fee for a 120-day trading volume of less than 400 BTC and 0.5% for a trading volume greater than 2,000 BTC. It also allows customers to deposit or withdraw cash using a prepaid debit card that costs CA$10 for the card and CA$2 for each cash withdrawal from an ATM. The process can be complicated and daunting for a new user, which is one reason Drummond welcomes bitcoin ATMs in Canada.""I feel ATMs will be good exposure to the public for BTC,"" Drummond said.In Toronto, Canada\'s commercial capital, an ATM has been installed at Bitcoin Decentral, a co-working space dedicated to bitcoin businesses in the city\'s downtown. The space is 5,500 sq ft spread over four floors. The ATM is run by the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, according to a report from the Toronto Star. It\'s unclear what type of machine has been installed, but it appears that it is not a Lamassu, as the Star reports that it can perform two-way conversions between bitcoin and fiat currency.Vancouver was the world\'s first city to have a bitcoin ATM permanently installed last October. That Robocoin unit made waves after it reportedly accepted more than CA$1m in deposits in its first 29 days of operation. Its operator, Bitcoiniacs, said in December that it would install Robocoin machines in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto and Calgary in December, but the Bitcoiniacs website only lists the Vancouver machine.Manufacturers of bitcoin ATMs, Lamassu and Robocoin, have been engaged in a race to sell their machines around the world. Lamassu announced it had sold its 100th unit. New players have been entering the scene, ranging from the open-source Skyhook ATM to Canada\'s homegrown Bitaccess BTM.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But, as with all great success stories, one inspired idea paves the way for an onslaught of wildly inferior ones, and the daddy of altcoins has spawned hundreds of copycats. Simply being a decentralized, peer-to-peer currency was soon no longer enough, and lo and behold—a wave of digital money meme-ry was born.Yep, the fiscal potential of altcoins now plays second fiddle to the kitsch factor, spearheaded by the introduction of Dogecoin last year. So here’s a guide to some of the key players in the cryptocoin market (plus some others that deserve a spot for being sufficiently weird):DogecoinIt’s only right to begin this list with Dogecoin, the currency based on 2013’s Meme of the Year (no really that’s a thing now), Doge. A Shiba Inu pooch with a poor grasp of spelling may seem like a peculiar choice for a meme, but self-confessed “shibes” all over the globe have taken the little fuzzmeister into their hearts—and now their bank accounts—with the introduction of Dogecoin. The currency’s co-creator Jackson Palmer muses: “I think the real reason for Dogecoin’s success is that it’s added a friendly face to the notion of a global, digital currency—in turn, we’ve built a large passionate community of users, for many of whom Dogecoin is their first experience with cryptocurrency.”The canine-faced coin functions less as a means of turning a profit, but rather as a way of ‘tipping’ fellow internet users in online games or social networks. Billy Markus —Palmer’s partner in coin crime—estimates that their creation has triggered a steep rise in new cryptocurrencies making their way to market, with anything from five to 15 being launched every day. Compare this to the fact that less than one per week were circulating before Dogecoin came out, and it’s clear that this cutely packaged computer cash packs a serious punch.While some might question why we need to brand these digital dollars with memes, Brett Scott, author of The Heretic’s Guide to Global Finance , believes that they are crucial to a cryptocurrency’s success by provoking an emotional response from its users: “Any belief in currency—whether it be a paper note, or a piece of metal, or digital bytes, is essentially irrational and requires some emotional leap of faith.” Scott’s belief in Dogecoin is so solid that he accepts it as payment for his book, adding: “I believe the symbol has enough emotional power to form the basis for a future cultural system of value.”Coinye WestAnd when it comes to cultural value, we really need look no further than Kanye West, the inspiration behind 2014’s first major cryptocurrency, Coinye West. ‘I don’t know what’s better, gettin’ laid or gettin’ paid,’ rapped the self-proclaimed “nucleus” in This Way, and it seems the currency’s creators are trying to experience at least one of those things for the first time by gathering some Coinye capital.The altcoin launched in a blaze of legal fury last week after KW’s lawyers tried to shut it down, irate that the sole product in the world West doesn’t already have his own line of would go to market with his name on it. “It remains to be seen if Coinye will be much more than another PR black eye on the cryptocurrency community at large,” says Rackspace developer Jesse Noller. “It may be a good idea, but they launched it as a pure marketing jump after seeing the success of Dogecoin. It was a classic pump and dump: hype, pre-mine the coin, launch, cash out.”While Coinye’s mascot has now inexplicably morphed into a blinged up ‘n’ bloated Kanye fish face, the entire messy enterprise has given cryptocurrency naysayers extra ammo in denouncing digital dollars. “Bitcoin [and its variants] has become synonymous with everything wrong with Silicon Valley: a marriage of dubious technology and questionable economics wrapped up in a crypto-libertarian political agenda that smacks of nerds-do-it-better paternalism,” blasts former Twitter engineer Alex Payne .

Relying on the fluffiness factor to give them a popularity boost, the burgeoning currency is already attempting to scoop up Dogecoin defectors on reddit and increase its market value. Most of these bitcoin wannabes fall apart soon enough, though, and it remains to be seen whether Catcoin will really make its mark. “It’s completely impossible to say whether there is room for multiple cryptocurrencies to stick around,” Doernberg elaborates, “but if there is, Dogecoin or another coin like it has strong potential as a family friendly coin used in online games and to tip on social networks.”While cryptocoin defenders are keen to extol the virtues of their online community, it does raise (even more) questions about what the actual point of all this pretend computer cash is. Is it intended as an economic game-changer that people can make real money from, or just a way of dishing out likes or recommends with a furry mascot attached? And, if it’s the latter, why name the currencies something so closely aligned to the libertarian ideology of bitcoin? Such questions, very confuse, etc.RonPaulcoi nLet’s move back from the deep and meaningful to the sheer ridiculous, which has helpfully been bestowed unto us by the creators of RonPaulcoin. Yes, that’s correct, a digital currency dedicated to the “intellectual godfather” of the Tea Party. The senior political Paul has been outspoken in his praise of bitcoin, telling CNN that it could “destroy the dollar” and cause a serious fiscal shake-up, so it seems like a logical step for him to be the face of one of its newest revamps. With a current market value of more than $28 per RPC and a ranking as the 47th most valuable of the 71 cryptocurrencies, this coin is climbing the ladder pretty quickly.But if RonPaulCoin is the start, where does this all end? With Obama bucks? De Blasio dollars? Joe Biden Gs? You get the picture, and it’s not a pretty one. (Well, it will be if Joe B’s Gs takes off. Here’s hoping).SexcoinThere’s only one logical move to make after RonPaulcoin: Sexcoin. This one seems to have a shred more purpose than its bitcoin-esque bedfellows as it promises a more private means of online transaction between performers, producers and consumers of adult material. It can be a little hard to take a cryptocurrency whose tagline is ‘Super Sexy and Delicious’ seriously, but with a current market capitalization ranking of 30, its performance isn’t too shabby.So where do we go with all of this screen money, and is it really likely to overthrow our economic infrastructures anytime soon? If anything, the deluge of heavily orchestrated ‘quirkiness’ these groups are trying to inject into the market is something of a turn off, and the regular risk these currencies seem to be at from hacking doesn’t do much to restore my faith that altcoins are just a bunch of computery nothingness. “I agree with the naysayers—in fact, I pretty much am a naysayer,” concludes Noller. “But somewhere in between thinking cryptocurrencies are the future and cryptocurrencies are neckbeard monopoly money is the truth. Just don’t invest real money. Please.”"", 'Is it possible to have an truly alternative altcoin? The developers behind new digital currency NXT think so - and they\'re gaining traction. The altcoin, which was officially launched on Jan 3rd, just signed BTER as an exchange partner.NXT works in a different way to bitcoin, and to other coins like litecoin that use different algorithms for mining. The currency isn\'t mined using computing power. Instead, it uses a version of Proof of Stake (PoS), which was a concept initially pioneered by peercoin.PoS works by awarding new coins to existing coinholders based on the number of coins they already have. The idea is to generate new coins without having to chew up vast amounts of energy as the bitcoin network does. NXT does this by working out how many coins everyone has, and using these figures in conjunction with a random math function to work out who will be forging the next block. That person then processes all of the transactions in the current block, and is awarded some coins for it.Avoiding double spend and 51% attacksOne of NXT\'s unique characteristics is that everyone knows who is going to be mining the next block. Everyone on the network then sends their transactions to that person. This drastically reduces traffic, claims the development team, while also decreasing confirmation times practically to zero. The team claims credit card-like transaction times.This solves a perennial issue faced by bitcoin users. They run the risk of a double spending attack, where someone sends a bitcoin and then persuades the rest of the network that it didn\'t happen, enabling them to spend the coin again somewhere else.To engineer that kind of attack, the fraudster would have to mine their own block with their own, falsified transaction records, separately to the rest of the network, and then convince others miners that they should accept it as the real one.To protect against that, bitcoiners are supposed to wait for the next block in the real block chain to be mined (which takes around ten minutes), before accepting a bitcoin payment. Some people suggest waiting for six confirmations, which can take longer. People on the bitcoin network often allow zero-confirmation bitcoin transactions, but they do it at their own risk.What\'s to stop someone on the NXT network from trying to convince the rest of the network that a transaction didn\'t actually happen? This is where a concept called transparent forging comes in.In NXT, everyone knows who\'s supposed to be mining the next block in the block chain. If they\'re trying to mine a fraudulent block and fork the chain, then that means that they can\'t be mining the real one. The network can detect this, and reduces that miner\'s mining power to zero, thus choking off their efforts.NXT is different to peercoin, which only uses PoS for part of its base of coins, using PoW for the rest. Peercoin will grow this percentage over time. NXT starts with 100% PoS, and isn\'t mining any coins, because they have already all been produced.""The term pre-mine does not apply to a true Proof-of-Stake (PoS) currency such as NXT, as there is no mining in the traditional sense of most coins, most notably bitcoin,"" said NiftyNickel, one of the coin\'s organizers. ""Investors gain additional coins through PoS based on transaction fees. Unlike PoS hybrid implementations, NXT is able to reward those that protect the network while avoiding inflating the money supply.""The NXT team created the entire base of NXT coins - one billion of them - in advance. 75 investors then purchased the coins, putting in a total of 21 BTC. They then began trading them directly in the forums, or via the first central exchange set up for that purpose, called DGEX. Investment was open to everyone, says NiftyNickel.""I have foreseen this in the peercoin paper that currencies could be issued like stock IPO,"" said Sunny King, founder of peercoin. ""Although we didn\'t attempt this approach for peercoin as we think the mining industry is a better method of issuance for currencies, probably more fair, but of course this is subjective and everyone could have different opinions.""John Manglaviti, King\'s community development manager on peercoin, who also helped to kick off the Feathercoin community in the early days, has been involved in NXT. He schooled NiftyNickel in some community building tactics, and also owns around $12,000 worth of coins at its current market cap.Manglaviti wishes NXT all the best, and welcomes an innovative coin into the altcoin community. Nevertheless, it has its challenges. One of the advantages of a hybrid PoW/PoS system, such as peercoin\'s is that not all of the coins are owned by a small group at one time.""If the initial distribution is rather small, in cases such as NXT, there has to be every effort from the community to encourage the original founders to distribute the coin as quickly as possible,"" he warns. ""If hoarding occurs, it will drastically effect the liquidity of the coin, the community will lose interest and the price will plummet.""BTER, which seems to be a haven for altcoins, might help to increase the coin\'s liquidity somewhat. In the long run, though, the NXT developers want to expand from central exchanges to a decentralized exchange mechanism. This is a tough technical problem, and various people have tried it in the past.NXT\'s team isn\'t afraid to pile on ambitious features. The team also wants to tackle some other problems, some of which have been successfully implemented with other coins, and some which haven\'t. No one coin has done them all yet.One such feature is a naming and messaging system. NXT Alias will allow a user to substitute a string for any uniform resource identifier (URI), which is a digital asset of any kind, such as a phone number, image, NXT account number, or web page.NXT\'s decentralized domain name and messaging system also enables people to host their own web sites and chat to each other anonymously. This is akin to the naming system in namecoin, although it will doubtless be implemented differently under the hood.Another thing that NXT promises is coloured coins, which is something that the bitcoin community has been discussing for a long time. This would enable coins to be \'marked\' with specific attributes, so that they could be used to describe other assets, including virtual ones (stocks, bonds, and derivatives), and physical ones (your house or car, perhaps).""On one hand, it\'s nice to see a coin attempt to do something different rather than being just another bitcoin/litecoin/peercoin clone with just basic parameters modified,"" said Manglaviti. ""The crypto community grows tired of all the knock-offs and NXT provides hope for a new direction. On the other hand, it\'s a brand new coin without a proven history. I would have much seen a rock solid user friendly client on day one, rather than some of the more flashy features that have been released.""NXT wants to impress, though. It has made its code open source, and the developers continue to add to it over time. So how much is it worth?Market capitalization is a tricky thing to calculate for a coin like this. Coinmarketmap.com, which includes NXT and Ripple in its list, puts NXT at number 6 in market cap. Dustcoin.com includes neither, rendering NXT invisible.NXT is worth a tiny fraction of bitcoin - far less than, say, a litecoin or a peercoin. When it was first distributed, a bitcoin was worth 47.6m NXT based on the amount invested, and the number of people who invested it. Or, to put it another way, each NXT was worth roughly one forty-seven millionth of a bitcoin.Now, at the current ask price, each NXT is worth roughly one six hundred thousandth of a bitcoin. That\'s a decent rise in just a few months of unofficial trading. It\'s still worth relatively little. But because the team released all of them at once, the coin can obtain a large market cap very quickly. A billion very cheap coins can be worth a lot.This makes NXT and bitcoin - even NXT and peercoin for that matter - entirely different animals. So whether you\'d want to include their market cap on a broader list or create a new one with hardly any coins on it is a personal decision.

New ATMs will be installed in the Canadian capital city Ottawa as well as Montreal and financial hub Toronto.The ATM operators are announcing their plans to install machines across the country even as Canada\'s central bank issued a statement yesterday declaring bitcoin is not recognised as legal tender there.Fadi Azouz, who operates the Montreal machine, said his ATM would be installed by 24th January at the Bitcoin Embassy in Montreal. It will take live rates from either BitStamp or the Canadian exchange Virtex and will charge a 5% fee for transactions. The \'embassy\' is a non-profit organisation dedicated to promoting bitcoin. Azouz said the central bank\'s announcement would have no impact on his plans:""The [statement] does not affect us at all. As long as the millions of people using bitcoin around the world continue to believe in it and trust it to be an honest method of payment, it shall continue to [be] just that.""Azouz added that his company, Vx5 Technologies, will be installing and operating bitcoin ATMs in eight countries this year. They include Lebanon, the Philippines, Hungary and Venezuela, among others.Azouz will not be operating a Lamassu or Robocoin machine, which are the two most well known manufacturers of bitcoin ATMs at present. Instead, he has opted for a machine built by an Ottawa company called Bitaccess. The firm calls its machines \'BTMs\'.Bitaccess makes a machine that converts fiat currency to bitcoin and another model that does two-way conversions. Current players Lamassu and Robocoin offer machines that convert fiat to bitcoin or two-way conversions respectively.The Ottawa ATM maker has also included a wallet-generation feature on its machines. This means the ATM can create a wallet for a user who does not have an existing way of storing bitcoins. According to Bitaccess, a high-entropy, one-time, paper wallet is generated, which is then scanned manually by the user. The company says it doesn\'t store any information about the printed wallets.Ottawa will also get a Bitaccess machine, according to a report from the Ottawa Citizen. The machine will be operated by a company called BIT-Capital, which also claims to run several cryptocurrency investment funds. The Ottawa ATM was installed in the Clocktower Brew Pub yesterday, according to the Citizen\'s report. The micro-brewery boasts four home-brewed beers and an ""upscale pub menu"".Tom Drummond, a bitcoin user in Ottawa, said he welcomed the arrival of an ATM in the city. He said his current method of buying bitcoin on Canadian exchange Virtex takes between two hours and three days, depending on how he transfers his money to the exchange.Virtex charges a 1.5% fee for a 120-day trading volume of less than 400 BTC and 0.5% for a trading volume greater than 2,000 BTC. It also allows customers to deposit or withdraw cash using a prepaid debit card that costs CA$10 for the card and CA$2 for each cash withdrawal from an ATM. The process can be complicated and daunting for a new user, which is one reason Drummond welcomes bitcoin ATMs in Canada.""I feel ATMs will be good exposure to the public for BTC,"" Drummond said.In Toronto, Canada\'s commercial capital, an ATM has been installed at Bitcoin Decentral, a co-working space dedicated to bitcoin businesses in the city\'s downtown. The space is 5,500 sq ft spread over four floors. The ATM is run by the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, according to a report from the Toronto Star. It\'s unclear what type of machine has been installed, but it appears that it is not a Lamassu, as the Star reports that it can perform two-way conversions between bitcoin and fiat currency.Vancouver was the world\'s first city to have a bitcoin ATM permanently installed last October. That Robocoin unit made waves after it reportedly accepted more than CA$1m in deposits in its first 29 days of operation. Its operator, Bitcoiniacs, said in December that it would install Robocoin machines in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto and Calgary in December, but the Bitcoiniacs website only lists the Vancouver machine.Manufacturers of bitcoin ATMs, Lamassu and Robocoin, have been engaged in a race to sell their machines around the world. Lamassu announced it had sold its 100th unit. New players have been entering the scene, ranging from the open-source Skyhook ATM to Canada\'s homegrown Bitaccess BTM.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But, as with all great success stories, one inspired idea paves the way for an onslaught of wildly inferior ones, and the daddy of altcoins has spawned hundreds of copycats. Simply being a decentralized, peer-to-peer currency was soon no longer enough, and lo and behold—a wave of digital money meme-ry was born.Yep, the fiscal potential of altcoins now plays second fiddle to the kitsch factor, spearheaded by the introduction of Dogecoin last year. So here’s a guide to some of the key players in the cryptocoin market (plus some others that deserve a spot for being sufficiently weird):DogecoinIt’s only right to begin this list with Dogecoin, the currency based on 2013’s Meme of the Year (no really that’s a thing now), Doge. A Shiba Inu pooch with a poor grasp of spelling may seem like a peculiar choice for a meme, but self-confessed “shibes” all over the globe have taken the little fuzzmeister into their hearts—and now their bank accounts—with the introduction of Dogecoin. The currency’s co-creator Jackson Palmer muses: “I think the real reason for Dogecoin’s success is that it’s added a friendly face to the notion of a global, digital currency—in turn, we’ve built a large passionate community of users, for many of whom Dogecoin is their first experience with cryptocurrency.”The canine-faced coin functions less as a means of turning a profit, but rather as a way of ‘tipping’ fellow internet users in online games or social networks. Billy Markus —Palmer’s partner in coin crime—estimates that their creation has triggered a steep rise in new cryptocurrencies making their way to market, with anything from five to 15 being launched every day. Compare this to the fact that less than one per week were circulating before Dogecoin came out, and it’s clear that this cutely packaged computer cash packs a serious punch.While some might question why we need to brand these digital dollars with memes, Brett Scott, author of The Heretic’s Guide to Global Finance , believes that they are crucial to a cryptocurrency’s success by provoking an emotional response from its users: “Any belief in currency—whether it be a paper note, or a piece of metal, or digital bytes, is essentially irrational and requires some emotional leap of faith.” Scott’s belief in Dogecoin is so solid that he accepts it as payment for his book, adding: “I believe the symbol has enough emotional power to form the basis for a future cultural system of value.”Coinye WestAnd when it comes to cultural value, we really need look no further than Kanye West, the inspiration behind 2014’s first major cryptocurrency, Coinye West. ‘I don’t know what’s better, gettin’ laid or gettin’ paid,’ rapped the self-proclaimed “nucleus” in This Way, and it seems the currency’s creators are trying to experience at least one of those things for the first time by gathering some Coinye capital.The altcoin launched in a blaze of legal fury last week after KW’s lawyers tried to shut it down, irate that the sole product in the world West doesn’t already have his own line of would go to market with his name on it. “It remains to be seen if Coinye will be much more than another PR black eye on the cryptocurrency community at large,” says Rackspace developer Jesse Noller. “It may be a good idea, but they launched it as a pure marketing jump after seeing the success of Dogecoin. It was a classic pump and dump: hype, pre-mine the coin, launch, cash out.”While Coinye’s mascot has now inexplicably morphed into a blinged up ‘n’ bloated Kanye fish face, the entire messy enterprise has given cryptocurrency naysayers extra ammo in denouncing digital dollars. “Bitcoin [and its variants] has become synonymous with everything wrong with Silicon Valley: a marriage of dubious technology and questionable economics wrapped up in a crypto-libertarian political agenda that smacks of nerds-do-it-better paternalism,” blasts former Twitter engineer Alex Payne .

Relying on the fluffiness factor to give them a popularity boost, the burgeoning currency is already attempting to scoop up Dogecoin defectors on reddit and increase its market value. Most of these bitcoin wannabes fall apart soon enough, though, and it remains to be seen whether Catcoin will really make its mark. “It’s completely impossible to say whether there is room for multiple cryptocurrencies to stick around,” Doernberg elaborates, “but if there is, Dogecoin or another coin like it has strong potential as a family friendly coin used in online games and to tip on social networks.”While cryptocoin defenders are keen to extol the virtues of their online community, it does raise (even more) questions about what the actual point of all this pretend computer cash is. Is it intended as an economic game-changer that people can make real money from, or just a way of dishing out likes or recommends with a furry mascot attached? And, if it’s the latter, why name the currencies something so closely aligned to the libertarian ideology of bitcoin? Such questions, very confuse, etc.RonPaulcoi nLet’s move back from the deep and meaningful to the sheer ridiculous, which has helpfully been bestowed unto us by the creators of RonPaulcoin. Yes, that’s correct, a digital currency dedicated to the “intellectual godfather” of the Tea Party. The senior political Paul has been outspoken in his praise of bitcoin, telling CNN that it could “destroy the dollar” and cause a serious fiscal shake-up, so it seems like a logical step for him to be the face of one of its newest revamps. With a current market value of more than $28 per RPC and a ranking as the 47th most valuable of the 71 cryptocurrencies, this coin is climbing the ladder pretty quickly.But if RonPaulCoin is the start, where does this all end? With Obama bucks? De Blasio dollars? Joe Biden Gs? You get the picture, and it’s not a pretty one. (Well, it will be if Joe B’s Gs takes off. Here’s hoping).SexcoinThere’s only one logical move to make after RonPaulcoin: Sexcoin. This one seems to have a shred more purpose than its bitcoin-esque bedfellows as it promises a more private means of online transaction between performers, producers and consumers of adult material. It can be a little hard to take a cryptocurrency whose tagline is ‘Super Sexy and Delicious’ seriously, but with a current market capitalization ranking of 30, its performance isn’t too shabby.So where do we go with all of this screen money, and is it really likely to overthrow our economic infrastructures anytime soon? If anything, the deluge of heavily orchestrated ‘quirkiness’ these groups are trying to inject into the market is something of a turn off, and the regular risk these currencies seem to be at from hacking doesn’t do much to restore my faith that altcoins are just a bunch of computery nothingness. “I agree with the naysayers—in fact, I pretty much am a naysayer,” concludes Noller. “But somewhere in between thinking cryptocurrencies are the future and cryptocurrencies are neckbeard monopoly money is the truth. Just don’t invest real money. Please.”"", 'Is it possible to have an truly alternative altcoin? The developers behind new digital currency NXT think so - and they\'re gaining traction. The altcoin, which was officially launched on Jan 3rd, just signed BTER as an exchange partner.NXT works in a different way to bitcoin, and to other coins like litecoin that use different algorithms for mining. The currency isn\'t mined using computing power. Instead, it uses a version of Proof of Stake (PoS), which was a concept initially pioneered by peercoin.PoS works by awarding new coins to existing coinholders based on the number of coins they already have. The idea is to generate new coins without having to chew up vast amounts of energy as the bitcoin network does. NXT does this by working out how many coins everyone has, and using these figures in conjunction with a random math function to work out who will be forging the next block. That person then processes all of the transactions in the current block, and is awarded some coins for it.Avoiding double spend and 51% attacksOne of NXT\'s unique characteristics is that everyone knows who is going to be mining the next block. Everyone on the network then sends their transactions to that person. This drastically reduces traffic, claims the development team, while also decreasing confirmation times practically to zero. The team claims credit card-like transaction times.This solves a perennial issue faced by bitcoin users. They run the risk of a double spending attack, where someone sends a bitcoin and then persuades the rest of the network that it didn\'t happen, enabling them to spend the coin again somewhere else.To engineer that kind of attack, the fraudster would have to mine their own block with their own, falsified transaction records, separately to the rest of the network, and then convince others miners that they should accept it as the real one.To protect against that, bitcoiners are supposed to wait for the next block in the real block chain to be mined (which takes around ten minutes), before accepting a bitcoin payment. Some people suggest waiting for six confirmations, which can take longer. People on the bitcoin network often allow zero-confirmation bitcoin transactions, but they do it at their own risk.What\'s to stop someone on the NXT network from trying to convince the rest of the network that a transaction didn\'t actually happen? This is where a concept called transparent forging comes in.In NXT, everyone knows who\'s supposed to be mining the next block in the block chain. If they\'re trying to mine a fraudulent block and fork the chain, then that means that they can\'t be mining the real one. The network can detect this, and reduces that miner\'s mining power to zero, thus choking off their efforts.NXT is different to peercoin, which only uses PoS for part of its base of coins, using PoW for the rest. Peercoin will grow this percentage over time. NXT starts with 100% PoS, and isn\'t mining any coins, because they have already all been produced.""The term pre-mine does not apply to a true Proof-of-Stake (PoS) currency such as NXT, as there is no mining in the traditional sense of most coins, most notably bitcoin,"" said NiftyNickel, one of the coin\'s organizers. ""Investors gain additional coins through PoS based on transaction fees. Unlike PoS hybrid implementations, NXT is able to reward those that protect the network while avoiding inflating the money supply.""The NXT team created the entire base of NXT coins - one billion of them - in advance. 75 investors then purchased the coins, putting in a total of 21 BTC. They then began trading them directly in the forums, or via the first central exchange set up for that purpose, called DGEX. Investment was open to everyone, says NiftyNickel.""I have foreseen this in the peercoin paper that currencies could be issued like stock IPO,"" said Sunny King, founder of peercoin. ""Although we didn\'t attempt this approach for peercoin as we think the mining industry is a better method of issuance for currencies, probably more fair, but of course this is subjective and everyone could have different opinions.""John Manglaviti, King\'s community development manager on peercoin, who also helped to kick off the Feathercoin community in the early days, has been involved in NXT. He schooled NiftyNickel in some community building tactics, and also owns around $12,000 worth of coins at its current market cap.Manglaviti wishes NXT all the best, and welcomes an innovative coin into the altcoin community. Nevertheless, it has its challenges. One of the advantages of a hybrid PoW/PoS system, such as peercoin\'s is that not all of the coins are owned by a small group at one time.""If the initial distribution is rather small, in cases such as NXT, there has to be every effort from the community to encourage the original founders to distribute the coin as quickly as possible,"" he warns. ""If hoarding occurs, it will drastically effect the liquidity of the coin, the community will lose interest and the price will plummet.""BTER, which seems to be a haven for altcoins, might help to increase the coin\'s liquidity somewhat. In the long run, though, the NXT developers want to expand from central exchanges to a decentralized exchange mechanism. This is a tough technical problem, and various people have tried it in the past.NXT\'s team isn\'t afraid to pile on ambitious features. The team also wants to tackle some other problems, some of which have been successfully implemented with other coins, and some which haven\'t. No one coin has done them all yet.One such feature is a naming and messaging system. NXT Alias will allow a user to substitute a string for any uniform resource identifier (URI), which is a digital asset of any kind, such as a phone number, image, NXT account number, or web page.NXT\'s decentralized domain name and messaging system also enables people to host their own web sites and chat to each other anonymously. This is akin to the naming system in namecoin, although it will doubtless be implemented differently under the hood.Another thing that NXT promises is coloured coins, which is something that the bitcoin community has been discussing for a long time. This would enable coins to be \'marked\' with specific attributes, so that they could be used to describe other assets, including virtual ones (stocks, bonds, and derivatives), and physical ones (your house or car, perhaps).""On one hand, it\'s nice to see a coin attempt to do something different rather than being just another bitcoin/litecoin/peercoin clone with just basic parameters modified,"" said Manglaviti. ""The crypto community grows tired of all the knock-offs and NXT provides hope for a new direction. On the other hand, it\'s a brand new coin without a proven history. I would have much seen a rock solid user friendly client on day one, rather than some of the more flashy features that have been released.""NXT wants to impress, though. It has made its code open source, and the developers continue to add to it over time. So how much is it worth?Market capitalization is a tricky thing to calculate for a coin like this. Coinmarketmap.com, which includes NXT and Ripple in its list, puts NXT at number 6 in market cap. Dustcoin.com includes neither, rendering NXT invisible.NXT is worth a tiny fraction of bitcoin - far less than, say, a litecoin or a peercoin. When it was first distributed, a bitcoin was worth 47.6m NXT based on the amount invested, and the number of people who invested it. Or, to put it another way, each NXT was worth roughly one forty-seven millionth of a bitcoin.Now, at the current ask price, each NXT is worth roughly one six hundred thousandth of a bitcoin.

Schloendorn told CoinDesk:""This probably makes it so that healthcare professionals, and in particular research scientists, are among the people who benefit the most from government deficit spending, and who therefore have the least need for bitcoin as a non-fiat alternative.""Still, Schloendorn refers to himself as ""the exception to the rule,"" though he is hoping to find other scientists who share his economic and medical beliefs.Science\'s reliance on big governmentSchloendorn sought out bitcoin due to what he called his lack of confidence in the government and its ability to run a stable economy. Schloendorn said:""Bitcoin seems to have serious potential as an alternative. So, I wanted to learn about that, and the best way to learn is by doing.""For now, doing means selling components to other scientists through his web store and providing contract research services for regenerative medicine. As for the future of stem cell science, Schloendorn is more confident:""I personally believe in the potential of regenerative medicine to provide \'spare parts\' for just about any disease, where any part of our body is broken. The beauty of this strategy is that you don\'t necessarily have to understand how the body works, or what exactly is wrong in each individual disease. All you really have to do is find a way to produce functional cells, tissues and organs.""Finding an audienceWhile he has yet to have his first bitcoin customer, Schloendorn is undeterred. Gene and Cell Technologies is building its product portfolio, and with this, Schloendorn expects to determine how he can target advertisements to other bitcoin-using scientists.Schloendorn hopes this new business will come with time, but is optimistic about bitcoin\'s potential in his field, especially given the problems he\'s had accepting gold.""I suppose it\'s still a lot of work to chop them into the correct size,"" Schloendorn said.Earlier this month, CoinDesk reported that an initiative called Project Marilyn was accepting bitcoin donations to fund work on a promising cancer fighting compound called 9DS.Researcher Isaac Yonemoto, a PhD scientist in chemistry and biophysics, said: “I’m raising money to finish preclinical experiments on the anticancer compound 9DS.

Más tarde, de él surgirían otras dos familias de sistemas operativos: los Linux y los BSD. La importancia de éstos últimos ha sido frecuentemente ignorada, pero realmente muchos usuarios de esta página usan, sin saberlo, uno de ellos: Darwin BSD, más conocido por sus adaptaciones comerciales para ordenadores personales (MacOSX) y para dispositivos móviles (iOS).El resto de la familia BSD está representada principalmente por FreeBSD (el más extendido y sencillo de usar), el NetBSD (centrado en su portabilidad: se ejecuta a día de hoy en 56 plataformas de hardware distintas) y el OpenBSD (destinado a conseguir un sistema de máxima seguridad: con constantes auditorías de código y potentes herramientas criptográficas, sus desarrolladores se enorgullecen de haber tenido sólo dos agujeros de seguridad en su instalación por defecto ¡en 19 años!).Éste último está mantenido por su fundador, Theo de Raadt, y por la Fundación OpenBSD. Hace menos de dos semanas, la fundación daba un aviso urgente: la deuda por el gasto eléctrico del proyecto ascendía a 20.000 dólares, el traslado de la infraestructura a otro lugar no era una opción, y si no se encontraban rápidamente fondos, el desarrollo de OpenBSD (y de otros importantes proyectos relacionados, como OpenSSH) sería sencillamente insostenible. Así que se puso de inmediato en marcha una campaña de recogida de donaciones, que consiguió su objetivo cuando poco después un usuario de un canal de IRC (¡sí, todavía existen!) preguntara con quién tenía que hablar para desembolsar el 100% de la cantidad solicitada. El nombre del acomodado benefactor es Mircea Popescu, el fundador de la Bolsa online de valores MPEx (y según los mentideros de la red, también polémico spammer y poseedor de sites porno).Lo particular de MPEx (y causa fundamental de la difusión de la noticia) es que es un servicio web que funciona con bitcoins, permitiendo (desde una interfaz austera y bastante poco amigable) adquirir opciones y futuros a múltiples brokers que se anuncian en foros de aficionados a la popular criptomoneda (siempre que depositen los 30 BTCs -más de 18.000 euros al cambio actual- necesarios para empezar a operar). Como dato final, MPEx proclamaba hace un año manejar el 90% de las operaciones financieras realizadas en esta divisa. Un ejemplo más de cómo, mientras los medios no terminan de tomarse muy en serio el debate sobre la moneda virtual de moda, existe todo un mundillo alejado del foco mediático pero capaz de mover grandes sumas de dinero gracias a las operaciones realizadas con la misma.Por cierto, ante el éxito de la campaña de donaciones (y la repercusión obtenida), la Fundación OpenBSD amplió el objetivo de recaudación hasta los 150.000 dólares, lo que garantizaría la supervivencia del proyecto durante un año y la organización de hackathones (encuentros de programadores).

As [the chart below] shows, if the historical Phillips- curve type relationship held, then the decline in the unemployment gap, which is the gap between the actual unemployment rate and the estimated longer-run equilibrium unemployment rate, would drive the growth rate of average hourly earnings steadily higher over the next couple of years.Some more reasons we may see wage growth.— "" The jobs hard to fill index in the NFIB\'s small business survey is at a five-year high and points to what could be a fairly dramatic acceleration in wage growth this year.""— "" From the JOLTS survey on labour turnover, the pick-up in the job openings rate and the voluntary job quits rate both point to an acceleration in the growth rate of average hourly earnings.""']","['Stem cell research, while still in its early stages, holds the opportunity for science to grow its understanding by leaps and bounds, unlocking doors that could protect humans against Alzheimer\'s Disease, Cancer, Heart Disease, HIV and AIDS, advocates say.Researching and fulfilling this potential is the goal of Gene and Cell Technologies, a California-based research center that recently moved into a 3,000-square-foot facility and now accepts bitcoin, as well as hard currencies like gold, for purchases at its online store.Founded in 2013, veteran stem cell researcher and Gene and Cell Technologies CEO John Schloendorn said the company is still ""ramping up"" its operations, producing the components that it will use when its new center is fully operational.Just three months in, his team is still focused primarily on the infrastructure that will support its ambitious initiatives, which include investigating stem cells and their use in cures to some of mankind\'s most notorious diseases.With no sales to date, Schloendorn sees bitcoin more as a way to address what he considers to be ""the problem with the medical industry"" and its over-reliance on government funding.

La importancia de éstos últimos ha sido frecuentemente ignorada, pero realmente muchos usuarios de esta página usan, sin saberlo, uno de ellos: Darwin BSD, más conocido por sus adaptaciones comerciales para ordenadores personales (MacOSX) y para dispositivos móviles (iOS).El resto de la familia BSD está representada principalmente por FreeBSD (el más extendido y sencillo de usar), el NetBSD (centrado en su portabilidad: se ejecuta a día de hoy en 56 plataformas de hardware distintas) y el OpenBSD (destinado a conseguir un sistema de máxima seguridad: con constantes auditorías de código y potentes herramientas criptográficas, sus desarrolladores se enorgullecen de haber tenido sólo dos agujeros de seguridad en su instalación por defecto ¡en 19 años!).Éste último está mantenido por su fundador, Theo de Raadt, y por la Fundación OpenBSD. Hace menos de dos semanas, la fundación daba un aviso urgente: la deuda por el gasto eléctrico del proyecto ascendía a 20.000 dólares, el traslado de la infraestructura a otro lugar no era una opción, y si no se encontraban rápidamente fondos, el desarrollo de OpenBSD (y de otros importantes proyectos relacionados, como OpenSSH) sería sencillamente insostenible. Así que se puso de inmediato en marcha una campaña de recogida de donaciones, que consiguió su objetivo cuando poco después un usuario de un canal de IRC (¡sí, todavía existen!) preguntara con quién tenía que hablar para desembolsar el 100% de la cantidad solicitada. El nombre del acomodado benefactor es Mircea Popescu, el fundador de la Bolsa online de valores MPEx (y según los mentideros de la red, también polémico spammer y poseedor de sites porno).Lo particular de MPEx (y causa fundamental de la difusión de la noticia) es que es un servicio web que funciona con bitcoins, permitiendo (desde una interfaz austera y bastante poco amigable) adquirir opciones y futuros a múltiples brokers que se anuncian en foros de aficionados a la popular criptomoneda (siempre que depositen los 30 BTCs -más de 18.000 euros al cambio actual- necesarios para empezar a operar). Como dato final, MPEx proclamaba hace un año manejar el 90% de las operaciones financieras realizadas en esta divisa. Un ejemplo más de cómo, mientras los medios no terminan de tomarse muy en serio el debate sobre la moneda virtual de moda, existe todo un mundillo alejado del foco mediático pero capaz de mover grandes sumas de dinero gracias a las operaciones realizadas con la misma.Por cierto, ante el éxito de la campaña de donaciones (y la repercusión obtenida), la Fundación OpenBSD amplió el objetivo de recaudación hasta los 150.000 dólares, lo que garantizaría la supervivencia del proyecto durante un año y la organización de hackathones (encuentros de programadores). Ya llevan recaudados 111.000 dólares, estando Google y Facebook como donantes.', 'Capital Economics\' Paul Ashworth is taking the view that wage growth is about to pick up.In a new research note, Ashworth argues that ""the current rates of wage and price inflation may be unusually low, but we are becoming increasingly concerned that the dwindling slack in the labor market will trigger a rise in wage inflation this year.""""Barring an unexpected acceleration in productivity growth, that pick-up in wage growth is likely to prompt a rebound in core inflation too,"" he writes.From Ashworth:In our recent US Focus ""Fed will eventually have to hike rates more rapidly"" (sent to clients on 13 th January), we argued that the rapid decline in the unemployment rate to only 6.7% in December last year, would eventually prompt a rise in wage inflation because the decline in the participation rate was primarily a structural rather than cyclical shift. As [the chart below] shows, if the historical Phillips- curve type relationship held, then the decline in the unemployment gap, which is the gap between the actual unemployment rate and the estimated longer-run equilibrium unemployment rate, would drive the growth rate of average hourly earnings steadily higher over the next couple of years.Some more reasons we may see wage growth.— "" The jobs hard to fill index in the NFIB\'s small business survey is at a five-year high and points to what could be a fairly dramatic acceleration in wage growth this year.""— "" From the JOLTS survey on labour turnover, the pick-up in the job openings rate and the voluntary job quits rate both point to an acceleration in the growth rate of average hourly earnings.""']"

In his new novel, Hanif Kureishi takes to a subject that has fascinated fiction-writers since Henry James’s The Aspern Papers. Harry Johnson – young, blond, expensively educated – is commissioned by his publisher to write a (preferably sensational) biography of a literary grand old man, Mamoon Azam. Harry has a lively libido, frustrated literary hopes and a girlfriend with a severe shopping habit; Mamoon has a giant literary reputation, a faltering bank balance, a yen for immortality and a wife with a severe shopping habit. Harry’s credentials for the job, we’re invited to believe, are that he has published a biography of Nehru “lightly spiced with interracial copulation, buggery, alcoholism and anorexia”, as befits the contemporary art of life-writing. He dreams of becoming a great novelist himself. Installed in Mamoon’s English country home, Harry quickly finds that in the face of the great man’s evasiveness the person to please is Liana, Mamoon’s current wife and anxious gatekeeper; that secrets lie with housekeeper Ruth and her daughter Julia; and that when he is joined by his girlfriend, the willowy fashionista Alice, things will start to get interesting. So begins a mighty stream of talk. Kureishi makes light work of the nitty-gritty of his subject’s life – how the shy scholarship boy from Madras survived the early years of loneliness and emotional chill in Britain to rise to the heights of literary eminence, with predictable sentimental baggage littering the path – because he is more interested in the ways in which people talk to each other, both succeeding and failing to make contact. Kureishi has a deft touch with the themes we’re expecting – the nature of truth, the perils of memory, the private versus the public man – and so neatly sidesteps some of the clichés of his storyline. Harry discovers the competing truths about Mamoon’s life through a circle of others – mainly women. He finds agonised outpourings in the explosively detailed diaries of Peggy, Mamoon’s late and much betrayed wife; he travels to New York for more sessions of emotional spillage from Marion, a longstanding and ultimately betrayed lover; he goes to India to talk to family members and “those Mamoon had supposedly snubbed, insulted, exploited, or fucked”; he discovers the (all too predictable) role of the housekeeper Ruth. He talks and talks to Liana, with all her greediness and petty ambitions. With all the treachery of the quester-after-truth, Harry manages to pass Mamoon’s lurid (and possibly fictitious) sexual history from one woman to another. As for Mamoon and Harry, they do what such men do, using conversation as a form of peacock display, sexual and intellectual competition thinly veneered by civilised discourse. “You’re in the remembering business,” Mamoon says to Harry, in one lengthy talk-session, “while I’m in the forgetting game – and forgetting is the loveliest of the psychic luxuries, a warm scented bath for the soul.” Then comes the thrust: “I have to say, I particularly like it when you remember things which never happened.” Kureishi’s great strength is his way with dialogue: his screenwriting credits outweigh his output of fiction. It’s a talent that produced My Beautiful Laundrette in 1985 – a brilliant cultural milestone in Britain’s adjustment of its self-image as a multicultural nation, which rightly propelled Kureishi to early stardom – and most recently Le Week-End, a gently incisive film about middle-aged yearnings. But in The Last Word he too often falls into the trap of speechmaking. Characters sound suspiciously alike: their author addresses us through them more or less indiscriminately. He cannot resist a bon mot (“What was marriage but sex plus property – property being the thing ... ”) and he has fun rattling the bien-pensants (Mamoon “didn’t want to be deprived of the jouissance of racism just because he had brown skin and had suffered it himself”). A low thrum of misogyny runs through the story – it’s a significant theme in Kureishi’s work, and his handling of it has got him into trouble in the past. Justified here by Mamoon’s Muslim background, it is played out in still more talk: “The young female body is at the centre of the world, and usually at the centre of most elections – abortion, single mothers, maternity leave, prostitution, incest, abuse, the hijab ... ” Mamoon informs Harry, while Harry later counters: “The fear, if not hatred, of women, of course, is at the centre of many religions.” Although this is counterpointed by some lively sexual descriptions and the general assumption that a session in Bond Street with a warm credit card will cure any female malaise, the women hold much of the power here too: Alice’s skills as a masseuse get her closer to Mamoon than all the hours of Harry’s clever talk. If Mamoon becomes an invention of the frustrated young novelist, “someone who had lived only so that Harry could write a book about him”, this sets up an interesting competition with Kureishi himself. Can he do what Harry couldn’t: bring Mamoon to life? As the plot is hurried to a finale that holds few surprises – just like life – what Kureishi makes us think about is that process is everything, that the journey itself is far more interesting than its supposed end. That living, in the end, trumps biography.

Het toekomstige stadion van de Koninklijke wordt al vergeleken met een 'buitenaards ruimteschip'.In 2017 moet de verbouwing af zijn. Op dezelfde plek als het huidige stadion ontstaat een groter multifunctioneel complex met plek voor 90 duizend toeschouwers.

Het doel is ambitieus: dit moet in 2017 het mooiste stadion ter wereld zijn.Opvallend in het ontwerp zijn de vloeiende vormen en het glimmende titanium aan de buitenkant. Dat laatste noemt Real een 'smart skin', waar ook beelden op zijn te projecteren. Er is ook een uitschuifbaar dak, net als in de ArenA. In een ring aan de binnenkant loopt een lcd-scherm helemaal rond. Er komen in het complex luxe winkels, restaurants en drie hypermoderne hotels.

Kureishi has a deft touch with the themes we’re expecting – the nature of truth, the perils of memory, the private versus the public man – and so neatly sidesteps some of the clichés of his storyline. Harry discovers the competing truths about Mamoon’s life through a circle of others – mainly women. He finds agonised outpourings in the explosively detailed diaries of Peggy, Mamoon’s late and much betrayed wife; he travels to New York for more sessions of emotional spillage from Marion, a longstanding and ultimately betrayed lover; he goes to India to talk to family members and “those Mamoon had supposedly snubbed, insulted, exploited, or fucked”; he discovers the (all too predictable) role of the housekeeper Ruth. He talks and talks to Liana, with all her greediness and petty ambitions. With all the treachery of the quester-after-truth, Harry manages to pass Mamoon’s lurid (and possibly fictitious) sexual history from one woman to another. As for Mamoon and Harry, they do what such men do, using conversation as a form of peacock display, sexual and intellectual competition thinly veneered by civilised discourse. “You’re in the remembering business,” Mamoon says to Harry, in one lengthy talk-session, “while I’m in the forgetting game – and forgetting is the loveliest of the psychic luxuries, a warm scented bath for the soul.” Then comes the thrust: “I have to say, I particularly like it when you remember things which never happened.” Kureishi’s great strength is his way with dialogue: his screenwriting credits outweigh his output of fiction. It’s a talent that produced My Beautiful Laundrette in 1985 – a brilliant cultural milestone in Britain’s adjustment of its self-image as a multicultural nation, which rightly propelled Kureishi to early stardom – and most recently Le Week-End, a gently incisive film about middle-aged yearnings. But in The Last Word he too often falls into the trap of speechmaking. Characters sound suspiciously alike: their author addresses us through them more or less indiscriminately. He cannot resist a bon mot (“What was marriage but sex plus property – property being the thing ... ”) and he has fun rattling the bien-pensants (Mamoon “didn’t want to be deprived of the jouissance of racism just because he had brown skin and had suffered it himself”). A low thrum of misogyny runs through the story – it’s a significant theme in Kureishi’s work, and his handling of it has got him into trouble in the past. Justified here by Mamoon’s Muslim background, it is played out in still more talk: “The young female body is at the centre of the world, and usually at the centre of most elections – abortion, single mothers, maternity leave, prostitution, incest, abuse, the hijab ... ” Mamoon informs Harry, while Harry later counters: “The fear, if not hatred, of women, of course, is at the centre of many religions.” Although this is counterpointed by some lively sexual descriptions and the general assumption that a session in Bond Street with a warm credit card will cure any female malaise, the women hold much of the power here too: Alice’s skills as a masseuse get her closer to Mamoon than all the hours of Harry’s clever talk. If Mamoon becomes an invention of the frustrated young novelist, “someone who had lived only so that Harry could write a book about him”, this sets up an interesting competition with Kureishi himself. Can he do what Harry couldn’t: bring Mamoon to life? As the plot is hurried to a finale that holds few surprises – just like life – what Kureishi makes us think about is that process is everything, that the journey itself is far more interesting than its supposed end. That living, in the end, trumps biography.

Het is een spectaculair ontwerp geworden, zoals is te zien op dit filmpje. Het toekomstige stadion van de Koninklijke wordt al vergeleken met een 'buitenaards ruimteschip'.In 2017 moet de verbouwing af zijn. Op dezelfde plek als het huidige stadion ontstaat een groter multifunctioneel complex met plek voor 90 duizend toeschouwers. Het winnende design komt van de Duitse architect Volkwin Marg en hij krijgt ook hulp van de Catalaanse (!) architect Josep Ribas. Het doel is ambitieus: dit moet in 2017 het mooiste stadion ter wereld zijn.Opvallend in het ontwerp zijn de vloeiende vormen en het glimmende titanium aan de buitenkant. Dat laatste noemt Real een 'smart skin', waar ook beelden op zijn te projecteren. Er is ook een uitschuifbaar dak, net als in de ArenA. In een ring aan de binnenkant loopt een lcd-scherm helemaal rond. Er komen in het complex luxe winkels, restaurants en drie hypermoderne hotels. O ja, ergens ligt ook nog een grasmat waar spelers van 100 miljoen euro tegen een balletje trappen…De bouwkosten zijn zeker 400 miljoen euro. Maar Real Madrid zwemt in het geld, ondanks dat er nog wel een 'kleine' schuld van zo'n 90 miljoen euro is. De Spaanse topclub draait tegenwoordig een half miljard euro omzet per jaar.""]"

02/09/2014,"['Somewhere in South London, an organic grocery store is accepting payment for goods in a currency that is not controlled by the Bank of England, and that is transmitted by text from a cellphone.What may be surprising is that it’s not another trendy store cashing in on the bitcoin bump. Instead, it’s a Brixton shopkeeper taking a local currency that has been in existence since around the same time Satoshi Nakamoto released his fateful paper.The store is Brixton Wholefoods and its owner is Tony Benest, a 30-year resident of the South London neighbourhood. Benest recently signed up so that his shop could accept the local currency, the Brixton Pound, by SMS. He said:“It’s an additional form of payment for people who don’t have a credit or debit card, or don’t want to get involved with the banks.”The Brixton Pound is one of the United Kingdom’s best-known local currencies. It’s been available as paper notes since 2009 and is emblazoned with the faces of famous residents, like David Bowie. But how has the rise of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies affected the South London denomination’s fortunes?According to Brett Scott, a Brixton resident and author of The Heretic’s Guide to Global Finance, the Brixton Pound has become popular in the past year, but not because bitcoin has paved the way. While the Brixton Pound and bitcoin are both alternative currencies that don’t rely on the Bank of England, they attract users for different reasons.“In reality, bitcoin tends to appeal to a very different crowd. Local currencies are all about building community ties, whereas bitcoin [...] is focused on preserving personal autonomy and personal wealth,” he said.Leander Bindewald, a researcher on complementary currencies at the New Economics Foundation, also noted that because bitcoin and local currencies appeal to such different constituencies, the cryptocurrency hasn\'t translated into gains for local units of exchange.""Bitcoin\'s big user community has never merged with a local community. [Local currencies] are intrinsically different from bitcoin,"" he said.Bitcoin leads the wayFor all the differences between something like bitcoin and the Brixton Pound, though, digital currencies may still be aiding the adoption of local currencies in an indirect way.“Policy makers are realising that bitcoin is asking questions they can’t answer. In this case, it’s great because bitcoin is challenging the paradigm.”Bindewald believes bitcoin’s prominence has helped push questions about regulation to the forefront for policy makers. The spotlight may be on bitcoin, but some of it is reflecting onto local currencies too.“Policy makers are realising that bitcoin is asking questions they can’t answer. In this case, it\'s great because bitcoin is challenging the paradigm,” he said.Tom Shakhli, who is the engagement manager for the Brixton Pound, agrees that bitcoin’s rise is aiding accepting of alternative currencies as a whole.While Shakhli highlights the differences in user-base between digital cryptocurrencies and something like the Brixton Pound, a local currency, he admits that for the general public, both units of transaction are often lumped together. While bitcoin is rising in prominence, the Brixton Pound also gets more attention.“We all fall under the same umbrella, which is alternatives to national currencies. We are all part of that family, I guess. Each one gives the other more credibility,” he said.Shakhli takes it a step further. He predicts that digital currencies and local currencies will rise in popularity in tandem:“I imagine in five years’ time, there’ll be some really popular digital currencies, and maybe 50 more local currencies in the UK. I think that’s a safe prediction.”But it’s not all plain sailing for alternative currencies. As Bindewald points out, there are dangers for local currencies if they become too closely associated with bitcoin. Regulators may be tempted to treat all alternative currencies the same way, to the detriment of local currencies, although Bindewald notes that this is a plausible, although unlikely, scenario.“There might be negative effects, if the regulation of bitcoin goes in such a way that all alternative currencies are thrown into the same bucket and then dismissed by the regulator,” he said.Alternative sceneThe Brixton Pound isn’t the UK’s first local currency. That honour belongs to the town of Totnes in south Devon, with a population of about 7,000 residents.The largest local currency economy in the UK is Bristol, where its pound is also heavily supported by the local authority. Bristol residents can pay their council tax in Bristol Pounds and the city\'s mayor has his salary paid in the local currency.According to the New Economic Foundation’s Lindewald, local currencies and other alternatives are picking up momentum, not just in the UK but worldwide. One project he is working on is called TradeQoin, a network of small businesses in Europe that issue lines of credit to one another. Bindewald explained:“There is no central authority issuing credit. This gives businesses more liquidity, cheaper credit and makes them less likely to fail.”But for all the talk of global transformation through alternative currencies, it’s merchants like Tony Benest at Brixton Wholefoods who will ultimately deal with cryptocurrencies or local currencies as part of their daily trade.In addition to taking electronic Brixton Pounds, Benest also watches the Keiser Report for bitcoin news. Still, he doesn\'t consider himself an alternative currency enthusiast. Far from it, he has deep-seated reservations about them.“Bitcoin probably isn’t quite as convenient for a bit of local shopping. I’ve never even seen one outside of a television set [...] The Brixton Pound is a local gimmick. I don\'t think it makes much difference,” he said.He pointed to Brixton Village, a trendy complex of restaurants and cafes in the area, as symptomatic of the problems with the local currency:“The people in Brixton Village are very keen on the Brixton Pound. It’s a bit like a comment I read in an article about Brixton Village: ‘Saving the economy by people selling coffee to each other’.”A look at the Brixton PoundThe Brixton Pound (B£) was launched in September 2009 and is administered by the Brixton Pound Community Interest Company.When it was launched, it took the form of paper notes that were printed with the images of prominent locals, including the aforementioned rock star.To deter forgers, the notes are watermarked, contain a hologram, and are embossed and numbered. They are sold at about seven local cafes, shops and other businesses around Brixton.The idea behind the Brixton Pound is to boost the local economy by using currency that ‘sticks to Brixton’. It is meant to be a ‘complementary currency’ that is used alongside pounds sterling. The currency is valued at parity with sterling, except in some cases, where offers are made to users or merchants. The focus is on supporting smaller shops and traders who face competition from high street chains.Users of the Brixton Pound are given access to special offers on locally sold products, while merchants are given publicity by the organisation that promotes the currency.The organisation quotes research from the New Economics Foundation that found money spent with independent businesses circulates within the local economy three times longer than when it’s spent at a chain store.Since September 2011, the Brixton Pound has also been available in an electronic form. Users can transmit the currency by sending an SMS text from a mobile phone to a merchant’s mobile phone. According to Shakhli, 170 businesses have signed up for the electronic Brixton Pound, while more than 250 businesses accept the paper version.Merchants pay a 1.5% fee on electronic transactions, although Shakhli says that is cheaper than other payment providers like Mastercard or Visa. He adds that there are no additional subscription fees to accept electronic payments, nor are there costs involved in setting up point-of-sale machinery, such as card readers.Lambeth Council, the local authority, has supported the Brixton Pound in a big way. The council allows local people to use the local currency to pay their business rates.It also gives council staff the option to have their wages paid in Brixton Pounds. The authority is working on a borough-wide currency, called the Lambeth Pound, slated for release this year.“The council has been very supportive from the beginning. There is a correlation between a successful Brixton Pound and a successful Brixton in general, so they think it’s been good for the area and want to support it,” Shakhli said.Image Credit: Brixton Pound via brixtonpound.org, Brixton Village via k_tjaaa / Flickr, trader via jonny2love / Flickr.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Instead, it’s a Brixton shopkeeper taking a local currency that has been in existence since around the same time Satoshi Nakamoto released his fateful paper.The store is Brixton Wholefoods and its owner is Tony Benest, a 30-year resident of the South London neighbourhood. Benest recently signed up so that his shop could accept the local currency, the Brixton Pound, by SMS. He said:“It’s an additional form of payment for people who don’t have a credit or debit card, or don’t want to get involved with the banks.”The Brixton Pound is one of the United Kingdom’s best-known local currencies. It’s been available as paper notes since 2009 and is emblazoned with the faces of famous residents, like David Bowie. But how has the rise of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies affected the South London denomination’s fortunes?According to Brett Scott, a Brixton resident and author of The Heretic’s Guide to Global Finance, the Brixton Pound has become popular in the past year, but not because bitcoin has paved the way. While the Brixton Pound and bitcoin are both alternative currencies that don’t rely on the Bank of England, they attract users for different reasons.“In reality, bitcoin tends to appeal to a very different crowd. Local currencies are all about building community ties, whereas bitcoin [...] is focused on preserving personal autonomy and personal wealth,” he said.Leander Bindewald, a researcher on complementary currencies at the New Economics Foundation, also noted that because bitcoin and local currencies appeal to such different constituencies, the cryptocurrency hasn\'t translated into gains for local units of exchange.""Bitcoin\'s big user community has never merged with a local community. [Local currencies] are intrinsically different from bitcoin,"" he said.Bitcoin leads the wayFor all the differences between something like bitcoin and the Brixton Pound, though, digital currencies may still be aiding the adoption of local currencies in an indirect way.“Policy makers are realising that bitcoin is asking questions they can’t answer. In this case, it’s great because bitcoin is challenging the paradigm.”Bindewald believes bitcoin’s prominence has helped push questions about regulation to the forefront for policy makers. The spotlight may be on bitcoin, but some of it is reflecting onto local currencies too.“Policy makers are realising that bitcoin is asking questions they can’t answer. In this case, it\'s great because bitcoin is challenging the paradigm,” he said.Tom Shakhli, who is the engagement manager for the Brixton Pound, agrees that bitcoin’s rise is aiding accepting of alternative currencies as a whole.While Shakhli highlights the differences in user-base between digital cryptocurrencies and something like the Brixton Pound, a local currency, he admits that for the general public, both units of transaction are often lumped together. While bitcoin is rising in prominence, the Brixton Pound also gets more attention.“We all fall under the same umbrella, which is alternatives to national currencies. We are all part of that family, I guess. Each one gives the other more credibility,” he said.Shakhli takes it a step further. He predicts that digital currencies and local currencies will rise in popularity in tandem:“I imagine in five years’ time, there’ll be some really popular digital currencies, and maybe 50 more local currencies in the UK. I think that’s a safe prediction.”But it’s not all plain sailing for alternative currencies. As Bindewald points out, there are dangers for local currencies if they become too closely associated with bitcoin. Regulators may be tempted to treat all alternative currencies the same way, to the detriment of local currencies, although Bindewald notes that this is a plausible, although unlikely, scenario.“There might be negative effects, if the regulation of bitcoin goes in such a way that all alternative currencies are thrown into the same bucket and then dismissed by the regulator,” he said.Alternative sceneThe Brixton Pound isn’t the UK’s first local currency. That honour belongs to the town of Totnes in south Devon, with a population of about 7,000 residents.The largest local currency economy in the UK is Bristol, where its pound is also heavily supported by the local authority. Bristol residents can pay their council tax in Bristol Pounds and the city\'s mayor has his salary paid in the local currency.According to the New Economic Foundation’s Lindewald, local currencies and other alternatives are picking up momentum, not just in the UK but worldwide. One project he is working on is called TradeQoin, a network of small businesses in Europe that issue lines of credit to one another. Bindewald explained:“There is no central authority issuing credit. This gives businesses more liquidity, cheaper credit and makes them less likely to fail.”But for all the talk of global transformation through alternative currencies, it’s merchants like Tony Benest at Brixton Wholefoods who will ultimately deal with cryptocurrencies or local currencies as part of their daily trade.In addition to taking electronic Brixton Pounds, Benest also watches the Keiser Report for bitcoin news. Still, he doesn\'t consider himself an alternative currency enthusiast. Far from it, he has deep-seated reservations about them.“Bitcoin probably isn’t quite as convenient for a bit of local shopping. I’ve never even seen one outside of a television set [...] The Brixton Pound is a local gimmick. I don\'t think it makes much difference,” he said.He pointed to Brixton Village, a trendy complex of restaurants and cafes in the area, as symptomatic of the problems with the local currency:“The people in Brixton Village are very keen on the Brixton Pound. It’s a bit like a comment I read in an article about Brixton Village: ‘Saving the economy by people selling coffee to each other’.”A look at the Brixton PoundThe Brixton Pound (B£) was launched in September 2009 and is administered by the Brixton Pound Community Interest Company.When it was launched, it took the form of paper notes that were printed with the images of prominent locals, including the aforementioned rock star.To deter forgers, the notes are watermarked, contain a hologram, and are embossed and numbered. They are sold at about seven local cafes, shops and other businesses around Brixton.The idea behind the Brixton Pound is to boost the local economy by using currency that ‘sticks to Brixton’. It is meant to be a ‘complementary currency’ that is used alongside pounds sterling. The currency is valued at parity with sterling, except in some cases, where offers are made to users or merchants. The focus is on supporting smaller shops and traders who face competition from high street chains.Users of the Brixton Pound are given access to special offers on locally sold products, while merchants are given publicity by the organisation that promotes the currency.The organisation quotes research from the New Economics Foundation that found money spent with independent businesses circulates within the local economy three times longer than when it’s spent at a chain store.Since September 2011, the Brixton Pound has also been available in an electronic form. Users can transmit the currency by sending an SMS text from a mobile phone to a merchant’s mobile phone. According to Shakhli, 170 businesses have signed up for the electronic Brixton Pound, while more than 250 businesses accept the paper version.Merchants pay a 1.5% fee on electronic transactions, although Shakhli says that is cheaper than other payment providers like Mastercard or Visa. He adds that there are no additional subscription fees to accept electronic payments, nor are there costs involved in setting up point-of-sale machinery, such as card readers.Lambeth Council, the local authority, has supported the Brixton Pound in a big way. The council allows local people to use the local currency to pay their business rates.It also gives council staff the option to have their wages paid in Brixton Pounds. The authority is working on a borough-wide currency, called the Lambeth Pound, slated for release this year.“The council has been very supportive from the beginning. There is a correlation between a successful Brixton Pound and a successful Brixton in general, so they think it’s been good for the area and want to support it,” Shakhli said.Image Credit: Brixton Pound via brixtonpound.org, Brixton Village via k_tjaaa / Flickr, trader via jonny2love / Flickr.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Teo said:“No customer coins are ever exposed to a hot wallet.”“At itBit, bitcoin and fiat deposits and withdrawals are business as usual,” said Antony Lewis, business development manager for the exchange.“For withdrawals, we enforce a 72-hour withholding period,” Lewis said. “This can be reduced to 24-hours at a user’s request, if they enable multi-factor login authentication.”These waiting times are for user security purposes, which is something itBit takes seriously. The company provides a flow chart that shows how it handles transactions and the processes that are in place to protect investors.“Although some clients say they don’t like this, it gives them protection against unauthorized withdrawals,” Lewis explained.Free tradesBecause the company believes its secure bitcoin storage features will attract customers shaken by the recent events at other exchanges, itBit is doing a promotion – waiving some commissions for new customers“We are giving out trading credits so people can essentially trade for free,” Teo said. “If you deposit over $10,000 worth of BTC or currency, then we’ll provide you with a $50 trading credit.”For customers who deposit between $5,000 and 10,000 there will be a $25 trading credit, while those who fund their account with $2,000-$5,000 will get a $10 credit.itBit is currently attempting to get money transmitter business (MSB) licensing in the 48 US states that require it.

Many US-based customers, who Teo terms as ""institutional"", go this route. “We also don’t charge any withdrawal fees or any transaction fees,” Teo pointed out.Big in AsiaTeo says that itBit has a diverse and global clientele, and it has a large customer base in the Asia region. itBit has proved very popular with traders in Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Australia.While most customers are trading in US dollars, the euro and the Singapore dollar are also available trading pairs.itBit’s 15-person headquarters is sited in Singapore, but the company has offices in New York and Shanghai as well.Teo used to work in the finance industry in New York, and he believes the city will be important for cryptocurrencies.“We do have a very New York-based background. We think that New York will play a role in digital currencies over the next decade.”The company is hoping to expand its reach to mainland China soon.

Ben Horowitz, que investiu em plataformas como o Facebook e o Twitter quando elas estavam nascendo, e Felix Salmon, conhecido blogueiro financeiro da Reuters, jogaram um par de meias de alpaca sobre o futuro desta moeda criptografada e não regulamentada criada na internet e que permite realizar pagamentos instantâneos em qualquer parte do mundo. Se dentro de cinco anos 10% dos norte-americanos comprarem algo com bitcoins, Horowitz terá ganhado. Caso contrário, será Salmon.Sobre as meias de alpaca é porque uma empresa que vende esse produto nos Estados Unidos foi a primeira a aceitar esta criptomoeda (moeda codificada) como forma de pagamento em seu site.A moeda eletrônica enfrenta dias difíceis. Mt Gox, uma das maiores plataformas de negociação de bitcoins, suspendeu em 7 de fevereiro as transações por problemas técnicos; a Apple retirou o Blockchain, um aplicativo compatível com a bitcoin; e, no início desta semana, a Rússia proibiu o uso desta moeda em seu território, seguindo, assim, os passos da China, que criou a própria no ano passado.A bitcoin é uma moeda que permite transações entre usuários via P2P, um intercâmbio de informação entre iguais, canal utilizado na partilha de filmes e música de arquivo. A pessoa que as adquire na internet recebe uma chave alfanumérica – letras e números – de entre 27 e 34 caracteres, que permite fazer pagamentos a outras pessoas que disponham de uma carteira eletrônica. No mês passado, sua cotação vinha se mantendo mais ou menos estável, em torno de 850 dólares (2.030 reais). Em seus estágios iniciais, chegou a custar 10 dólares (23 reais). Mas nesta semana, após a suspensão do Mt Gox, recuava para cerca de 600 dólares (1.400 reais).“Ironias da vida”, diz Andrés Alonso, economista especializado em finanças do blogue sintetia.com, “a bitcoin sofreu um corralito e já tem vários”. O Mt Gox congelou as retiradas de fundos e os movimentos da moeda. “O problema é que as transferências podiam ser renomeadas”, explica Alonso, “uma falha atribuível ao algoritmo”.“Sofreu um corralito e já tem vários”, diz o economista Andrés AlonsoA memorável trajetória desta moeda eletrônica volta a reavivar o debate sobre a sua força e seu futuro.A bitcoin é um fenômeno que desperta todos os tipos de reações. Seus defensores acreditam que revolucionará o comércio eletrônico e o sistema econômico estabelecido.A empresa de capital de risco Adreessen Horowitz já investiu cerca de 36,5 milhões de euros (120 milhões de reais) em empresas relacionadas a bitcoins. Marc Adreessen, um dos seus sócios, argumentou em um artigo publicado no fim de janeiro no The New York Times que a bitcoin será uma revolução.Seus opositores, no entanto, acreditam que é uma febre que está criando uma bolha gigante. Entre estes últimos, está o renomado economista e professor da Universidade de Columbia, de Nova York, Xavier Sala-i-Martín.Pedro Durá, professor de Economia Monetária e Financeira da Universidade Complutense de Madri, considera normais as flutuações que a moeda vem experimentando: são poucos os detentores de bitcoins e as operações realizadas são escassas. “É um mercado com pouca liquidez”, explica ele, “uma operação de algum detentor de um grande volume de bitcoins faz com que sua cotação suba ou caia muito”. Durá explica que ocorre com a bitcoin o que acontece com muitos outros ativos que o mercado desconhece: a cotação flutua (como acontece com as novas ações que surgem na bolsa) até que os operadores começam a se familiarizar com o ativo. “Não é estranho que alguns governos, que veem isso como uma ameaça ao seu monopólio, imponham limites”, garante.Esta é uma das questões. A bitcoin poderia ser para o banco o que os downloads são para as músicas e filmes, dizem seus defensores: uma ameaça. Permite trocar dinheiro sem intermediários. A partir daí, há obstáculos que encontra em seu caminho, eles argumentam.Durá está entre os que pensam que se trata de um fenômeno interessante a se seguir. “Não é para temê-lo, o consumidor pode sair favorecido. Aqueles que temem as bitcoins são os que têm o monopólio da emissão de moeda”, explica. “Uma moeda que faz concorrência àquela emitida pelos governos pode ser uma boa para que cuidem e limitem suas emissões”.“Não é para temê-la”, diz o professor Pedro DuráA oferta de bitcoins está limitada. Essa é uma das vantagens, dizem seus defensores. Cresce a um ritmo que depende da resolução de operações exponencialmente complexas que só são feitas por meio de computadores. Cerca de 25 bitcoins são geradas a cada 10 minutos. A emissão vai se reduzindo com o passar do tempo. Em 2140, haverá 21 milhões de bitcoins e já não haverá mais. Atualmente, há cerca de 12,5 milhões em circulação.Andrés Alonso, do blogue sintetia.com, acredita, porém, que a bitcoin é uma aposta arriscada. É mais um ativo do que uma moeda, diz. “Todo mundo quer guardá-la, por isso não desempenha um papel como moeda”, manifesta. “É mais um bem como o ouro, como o petróleo. É o ouro 2.0”. Alonso diz que a bitcoin é pouco estável e muito volátil, de forma que não é uma alternativa para o euro ou o dólar. “O ponto forte do euro e o dólar é que têm um respaldo legal; com a bitcoin, depende-se da tecnologia”, resume.Pablo Soto, promotor da livre troca de arquivos P2P na Espanha, contra o que a indústria fonográfica vem contestando há anos nos tribunais, se mostra crítico. “A bitcoin é o sonho dos neoliberais, dos anarco-capitalistas”, ilustra. “É uma alternativa que pode ser pior do que o que temos em termos de concentração de capital”.']","['Singapore-based exchange itBit recently built a trading-specific platform for bitcoin; now it is offering a cut-price promotion in an attempt to draw in new customers.The company has not had any of the problems that other exchanges have been experiencing lately.

Ben Horowitz, que investiu em plataformas como o Facebook e o Twitter quando elas estavam nascendo, e Felix Salmon, conhecido blogueiro financeiro da Reuters, jogaram um par de meias de alpaca sobre o futuro desta moeda criptografada e não regulamentada criada na internet e que permite realizar pagamentos instantâneos em qualquer parte do mundo. Se dentro de cinco anos 10% dos norte-americanos comprarem algo com bitcoins, Horowitz terá ganhado. Caso contrário, será Salmon.Sobre as meias de alpaca é porque uma empresa que vende esse produto nos Estados Unidos foi a primeira a aceitar esta criptomoeda (moeda codificada) como forma de pagamento em seu site.A moeda eletrônica enfrenta dias difíceis. Mt Gox, uma das maiores plataformas de negociação de bitcoins, suspendeu em 7 de fevereiro as transações por problemas técnicos; a Apple retirou o Blockchain, um aplicativo compatível com a bitcoin; e, no início desta semana, a Rússia proibiu o uso desta moeda em seu território, seguindo, assim, os passos da China, que criou a própria no ano passado.A bitcoin é uma moeda que permite transações entre usuários via P2P, um intercâmbio de informação entre iguais, canal utilizado na partilha de filmes e música de arquivo. A pessoa que as adquire na internet recebe uma chave alfanumérica – letras e números – de entre 27 e 34 caracteres, que permite fazer pagamentos a outras pessoas que disponham de uma carteira eletrônica. No mês passado, sua cotação vinha se mantendo mais ou menos estável, em torno de 850 dólares (2.030 reais). Em seus estágios iniciais, chegou a custar 10 dólares (23 reais). Mas nesta semana, após a suspensão do Mt Gox, recuava para cerca de 600 dólares (1.400 reais).“Ironias da vida”, diz Andrés Alonso, economista especializado em finanças do blogue sintetia.com, “a bitcoin sofreu um corralito e já tem vários”. O Mt Gox congelou as retiradas de fundos e os movimentos da moeda. “O problema é que as transferências podiam ser renomeadas”, explica Alonso, “uma falha atribuível ao algoritmo”.“Sofreu um corralito e já tem vários”, diz o economista Andrés AlonsoA memorável trajetória desta moeda eletrônica volta a reavivar o debate sobre a sua força e seu futuro.A bitcoin é um fenômeno que desperta todos os tipos de reações. Seus defensores acreditam que revolucionará o comércio eletrônico e o sistema econômico estabelecido.A empresa de capital de risco Adreessen Horowitz já investiu cerca de 36,5 milhões de euros (120 milhões de reais) em empresas relacionadas a bitcoins. Marc Adreessen, um dos seus sócios, argumentou em um artigo publicado no fim de janeiro no The New York Times que a bitcoin será uma revolução.Seus opositores, no entanto, acreditam que é uma febre que está criando uma bolha gigante. Entre estes últimos, está o renomado economista e professor da Universidade de Columbia, de Nova York, Xavier Sala-i-Martín.Pedro Durá, professor de Economia Monetária e Financeira da Universidade Complutense de Madri, considera normais as flutuações que a moeda vem experimentando: são poucos os detentores de bitcoins e as operações realizadas são escassas. “É um mercado com pouca liquidez”, explica ele, “uma operação de algum detentor de um grande volume de bitcoins faz com que sua cotação suba ou caia muito”. Durá explica que ocorre com a bitcoin o que acontece com muitos outros ativos que o mercado desconhece: a cotação flutua (como acontece com as novas ações que surgem na bolsa) até que os operadores começam a se familiarizar com o ativo. “Não é estranho que alguns governos, que veem isso como uma ameaça ao seu monopólio, imponham limites”, garante.Esta é uma das questões. A bitcoin poderia ser para o banco o que os downloads são para as músicas e filmes, dizem seus defensores: uma ameaça. Permite trocar dinheiro sem intermediários. A partir daí, há obstáculos que encontra em seu caminho, eles argumentam.Durá está entre os que pensam que se trata de um fenômeno interessante a se seguir. “Não é para temê-lo, o consumidor pode sair favorecido. Aqueles que temem as bitcoins são os que têm o monopólio da emissão de moeda”, explica. “Uma moeda que faz concorrência àquela emitida pelos governos pode ser uma boa para que cuidem e limitem suas emissões”.“Não é para temê-la”, diz o professor Pedro DuráA oferta de bitcoins está limitada. Essa é uma das vantagens, dizem seus defensores. Cresce a um ritmo que depende da resolução de operações exponencialmente complexas que só são feitas por meio de computadores. Cerca de 25 bitcoins são geradas a cada 10 minutos. A emissão vai se reduzindo com o passar do tempo. Em 2140, haverá 21 milhões de bitcoins e já não haverá mais. Atualmente, há cerca de 12,5 milhões em circulação.Andrés Alonso, do blogue sintetia.com, acredita, porém, que a bitcoin é uma aposta arriscada. É mais um ativo do que uma moeda, diz. “Todo mundo quer guardá-la, por isso não desempenha um papel como moeda”, manifesta. “É mais um bem como o ouro, como o petróleo. É o ouro 2.0”. Alonso diz que a bitcoin é pouco estável e muito volátil, de forma que não é uma alternativa para o euro ou o dólar. “O ponto forte do euro e o dólar é que têm um respaldo legal; com a bitcoin, depende-se da tecnologia”, resume.Pablo Soto, promotor da livre troca de arquivos P2P na Espanha, contra o que a indústria fonográfica vem contestando há anos nos tribunais, se mostra crítico. “A bitcoin é o sonho dos neoliberais, dos anarco-capitalistas”, ilustra. “É uma alternativa que pode ser pior do que o que temos em termos de concentração de capital”.']"

03/02/2014,"['BitcoinFresh off its filing for bankruptcy protection, Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox is taking the first steps to set its ship aright.The Japan-based Mt. Gox said in a March 2 notice posted on its Web site that it has set up a call center to ""respond to all inquiries."" The brief posting, in both Japanese and English, provides a phone number and gives the hours of operation as 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Japan time, Monday through Friday. (That works out to 5 p.m. to midnight PT, Sunday through Thursday.)The call center is set to go into operation on Monday.The posting calls the notice an ""announcement regarding an application for commencement of a procedure of civil rehabilitation,"" which sounds like a regulator-mandated and very bureaucratic way of saying that Mt. Gox\'s call center is phase one of the Bitcoin exchange\'s hoped-for recovery.Mt. Gox made its bankruptcy filing Friday, as CEO Mark Karpeles acknowledged a massive loss of bitcoins -- 100,000 of its own, and nearly 750,000 belonging to its customers -- with total value approaching $500 million.Karpeles said that flaws in the company\'s computer systems allowed hackers to siphon off the large volume of the virtual currency.Mt. Gox has $63.6 million in debt, about twice what it has in assets.In the last year, Bitcoin has escaped the bounds of its geeky origins to become a lightning rod, controversial enough now that last week US Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W. Va.) called for a ban on the digital currency, calling it ""highly unstable and disruptive to our economy"" and an aid to ""illicit activity."" But Bitcoin has fervent defenders, too, and entrepreneurs have sensed enough potential to begin fielding Bitcoin ATMs as the currency gets accepted in an increasing smattering of places.The Bitcoin exchange Coinbase lists a current buy price per bitcoin of $563.10.(Via Ars Technica.)', 'Yale Professor and Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller has a great piece in the New York Times today that shows why he\'s one of the greatest economic thinkers of our time.The piece is kind of about Bitcoin — which he continues to think is a straight-up bubble — but actually about how technology and electronic money can revolutionize the financial system in a good way.Shiller has three inter-related ideas, and surprisingly they all spring forth from something that Chile did in the 1960s, when it created a quasi-currency called the UF that was designed to track inflation. If inflation rapidly accelerated, the UF would become more valuable against the Chilean Peso, allowing UF holders to maintain buying power. Goods (like one\'s rent check) could be priced in UF, so that the price could stay the same all the time, automatically adjusting with inflation.Shiller proposes three ideas: First he thinks that other countries should adopt digital versions of the UF. He proposes calling them ""baskets"" reflecting the fact that their value will track a basket of goods. Then he suggests companies like Square and PayPal (at the forefront of digital money) should allow for automatic payments in these baskets, even across boarders, automatically adjusting for different currencies, etc.. And finally he proposes the creation of multiple baskets in each country, so that there could be one that reflects the needs of senior citizens (who buy different stuff than young people) and one that reflects young homeowners and so forth.And he also envisions financial assets that are directly linked to a country\'s growth:And there could be a “trills” unit — a concept that Mark Kamstra of York University and I have been advocating — that represents one trillionth of a country’s most recently estimated annual G.D.P. There should also be a unit that grows or retreats with per-capita daily consumption. This could be used for pension and Social Security payments as a form of intergenerational risk-sharing: The idea is that payments to older people would rise and fall with overall consumption. With many kinds of baskets, it will be easier to set prices and make contracts that are sensible for the long term.With digitization, all of this should be possible, allowing us to keep what works in our modern financial system, and upgrading it to make it even better.None of this will satisfy Bitcoin believers – who believe in a totally different kind of innovation — but this is a good starting point to how the existing system of money can be built upon.Get the latest Bitcoin price here.>>', 'Nick Tomaino is currently on the business development team at Coinbase, and is also a first-year business school student at the Yale School of Management. Prior to that, he worked in venture capital, most recently for Softbank Capital.It is becoming increasingly clear to the public that Bitcoin is compelling for merchants as a more efficient payment processing option.But one question that is far from clear and will likely take longer to become apparent is: what are the consumer benefits to using the digital currency, outside of investment and speculation?Most mainstream consumers view bitcoin as a volatile asset that has no true benefit for consumers looking to spend on goods and services. In Senator Joe Manchin’s letter to the Treasury Department, he wrote:“Its deflationary trends ensure that only speculators such as so-called ‘Bitcoin miners’ will benefit from possessing the virtual currency.”This is a dangerous misconception that is often voiced by newcomers to bitcoin. While bitcoin is currently volatile and there are clear risks associated with it, there are also major benefits to spending bitcoin that are likely to become apparent as consumers learn more about the digital currency: cost savings, privacy, and ease of use.Cost savingsCost savings may ultimately be the most compelling benefit for bitcoin consumers.The cost savings on the merchant side are clear when you consider the interchange fees, assessment fees, chargeback fees and false declines that merchants currently incur by using existing payment methods.Ultimately, these fees are passed on to consumers, evidenced by the $0.75 fee you may pay for a transaction under $10.We’re already seeing large merchants pass the cost savings bitcoin brings on to consumers. Tiger Direct is currently offering $20 off all orders over $100. Fancy.com is currently offering a 25% off coupon on all bitcoin purchases until Sunday.These promotions are short term, but we expect many large merchants to offer long term discounts on bitcoin purchases in the near future.As these cost savings continue, consumers will soon realize that unlike credit cards companies, who cause merchants to price their goods higher and pass savings back to only a subset of the consumer base (credit card holders in the form of reward points), bitcoin enables lower prices for the masses.PrivacyPrivacy is on the minds of many US consumers right now, following the significant security breaches that occurred over the past few months at large retailers such as Target and Neiman Marcus.These security breaches highlight a fundamental difference between bitcoin and traditional online payment methods.Generally, when you pay for something online with a debit or credit card, you are giving that merchant personally identifiable information about yourself that is susceptible to theft.While tokenization techniques are becoming more commonly used by credit card companies, these techniques are still susceptible to error. The full details of the Target breach haven’t emerged yet but many believe that the perpetrator found a way to circumvent Target’s tokenization.When a consumer uses bitcoin to pay for goods or services online, they only share the public key and the amount of the payment with the merchant. There is no personally identifiable information shared that makes the consumer susceptible to identity theft.In order for a consumer’s funds to be used, the public key and private key must be obtained by the thief. For consumers that value privacy and want to prevent identify theft, bitcoin provides an alternative to existing payment options.Ease of useAnyone that has used a Coinbase wallet to make a purchase on Overstock, Fancy or any of our 25,000 merchants has likely recognized that our two-click check out process is a truly seamless buying experience.Paying in bitcoin eliminates the need to enter personal information and jump through additional verification hoops, steps which most existing payment methods require.Coinbase and other bitcoin companies provide what is arguably the most frictionless checkout experience on the internet.These three key benefits are likely to appeal to different consumers, and it is unclear which one will become the primary driver of long-term consumer adoption.When the consumer Internet became widespread, we couldn’t have imagined amazing services like Airbnb or Uber being built on top of it – we’re at a similar place with the Bitcoin network.Since Bitcoin is still in the early stages of its development, the benefits to consumers are myriad, and those listed above will be realized very soon. But as the technology matures and becomes ever more mainstream, the possibilities are endless.Follow Nick Tomaino on Twitter.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Đây là phản ứng đầu tiên của ngân hàng trung ương đối với đồng tiền ảo này.Cửa hàng cà phê đầu tiên chấp nhận thanh toán bằng Bitcoin ở Hà Nội cho biết vẫn tiếp tục nhận Bitcoin sau động thái của Ngân hàng Nhà nước. Ảnh: Thanh BìnhTrước đó hai ngày, sàn giao dịch Bitcoin lớn nhất nhì thế giới Mt Gox bất ngờ đóng cửa, khiến giới đầu tư trong đó có cả ở Việt Nam, thiệt hại hàng trăm triệu USD.Đa số những người đang nắm giữ Bitcoin hoặc tham gia cộng đồng này trong nước tỏ ra không quá lo lắng trước những tin tức nêu trên. ""Trước đó, cũng đã có một số nước đã tuyên bố chấp thuận Bitcoin, nhưng cũng có nhiều nơi không công nhận. Do đó, chúng tôi cũng xác định trước rằng mình buôn bán Bitcoin sẽ không được pháp luật bảo vệ và có rủi ro"", một người đào Bitcoin chuyên nghiệp cho biết.Anh Bùi Huy Kiên, chủ công ty đầu tiên tuyên bố chấp nhận thanh toán quảng cáo bằng Bitcoin cho biết sẽ có điều chỉnh nhất định. Trước đây anh trưng dòng chữ ""Chấp nhận thanh toán bằng Bitcoin"" lên diễn đàn của mình, bây giờ sẽ đổi thành ""Chấp nhận Bitcoin"", như là hàng đổi hàng.Còn tại một quán cà phê chấp nhận Bitcoin ở Hà Nội, chủ quán khẳng định không hạ biển ""Bitcoin accepted here"" (Ở đây nhận Bitcoin) xuống vì việc nhận đổi cốc cà phê bằng đồng này không phạm pháp.Anh Vương - một người am hiểu về Bitcoin nhận định quan điểm của cơ quan quản lý sẽ ảnh hưởng nhiều nhất những người muốn xây dựng Bitcoin thành một phương tiện thanh toán. Khi đó, những người đang muốn dùng Bitcoin để mua dịch vụ, sản phẩm sẽ trở nên ngần ngại.""Dẫu vậy, kể cả cấm trong nước, cơ quan quản lý cũng khó mà kiểm soát được"", anh Vương nói thêm. Thực tế hiện nay, nhà đầu tư Việt chủ yếu mua bán, giao dịch Bitcoin trên các sàn ở nước ngoài. Một số sàn lớn mà nhà đầu tư Việt đang tham gia giao dịch là Btc-e, Cryptsy, Bitfinex hay Localbitcoins...Biểu đồ giá Bitcoin trong 6 tháng vừa rồi.Giới chuyên gia trong nước đang có ý kiến trái chiều về tương lai của Bitcoin sau động thái của Ngân hàng Nhà nước. Thạc sĩ Nguyễn Phan Anh, giảng viên khoa Thương mại Điện tử - Đại học Thương mại cho rằng Bitcoin ở Việt Nam phát triển không chính thống, lại ảo về giá trị nên khó có thể lan rộng trong cộng đồng. Theo ông, trào lưu này sẽ lắng xuống khi các quy định chính thức được đưa ra. ""Nếu muốn ủng hộ thương mại điện tử Việt Nam hiện đại, tôi nghĩ cần ưu tiên phương thức giao dịch, thanh toán bằng tiền mặt hoặc các phương tiện có sẵn khác được Ngân hàng Nhà nước thừa nhận"", vị chuyên gia nhấn mạnh.Ngược lại, một chuyên gia về thương mại điện tử khác lại nhận định với nguyên tắc ngang hàng giữa người chơi với nhau thì không chỉ Bitcoin mà các đồng tiền ảo, điện tử khác như Litecoin, WMZ… sẽ tồn tại và khó có thể xóa sạch do chúng mang lại cơ hội lướt sóng cho một bộ phận người dùng Internet.Tin Ngân hàng Nhà nước cấm các tổ chức tín dụng dùng Bitcoin không làm giá cả mặt hàng này thay đổi, cả ở tiền Việt lẫn giá thế giới. Tính đến cuối hết tháng 2/2014, mỗi Bitcoin trên sàn Bitstamp có giá 551 USD, ngang ngửa đầu tuần. Giá này hạ khoảng 200 USD so với đầu năm, và giảm hơn một nửa so với thời đỉnh cao - có lúc lên 1.100 USD hồi cuối năm ngoái.Thanh Bình - Công Tâm']","['BitcoinFresh off its filing for bankruptcy protection, Bitcoin exchange Mt.

Gox\'s call center is phase one of the Bitcoin exchange\'s hoped-for recovery.Mt. Gox made its bankruptcy filing Friday, as CEO Mark Karpeles acknowledged a massive loss of bitcoins -- 100,000 of its own, and nearly 750,000 belonging to its customers -- with total value approaching $500 million.Karpeles said that flaws in the company\'s computer systems allowed hackers to siphon off the large volume of the virtual currency.Mt. Gox has $63.6 million in debt, about twice what it has in assets.In the last year, Bitcoin has escaped the bounds of its geeky origins to become a lightning rod, controversial enough now that last week US Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W. Va.) called for a ban on the digital currency, calling it ""highly unstable and disruptive to our economy"" and an aid to ""illicit activity."" But Bitcoin has fervent defenders, too, and entrepreneurs have sensed enough potential to begin fielding Bitcoin ATMs as the currency gets accepted in an increasing smattering of places.The Bitcoin exchange Coinbase lists a current buy price per bitcoin of $563.10.(Via Ars Technica.)', 'Yale Professor and Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller has a great piece in the New York Times today that shows why he\'s one of the greatest economic thinkers of our time.The piece is kind of about Bitcoin — which he continues to think is a straight-up bubble — but actually about how technology and electronic money can revolutionize the financial system in a good way.Shiller has three inter-related ideas, and surprisingly they all spring forth from something that Chile did in the 1960s, when it created a quasi-currency called the UF that was designed to track inflation. If inflation rapidly accelerated, the UF would become more valuable against the Chilean Peso, allowing UF holders to maintain buying power. Goods (like one\'s rent check) could be priced in UF, so that the price could stay the same all the time, automatically adjusting with inflation.Shiller proposes three ideas: First he thinks that other countries should adopt digital versions of the UF. He proposes calling them ""baskets"" reflecting the fact that their value will track a basket of goods. Then he suggests companies like Square and PayPal (at the forefront of digital money) should allow for automatic payments in these baskets, even across boarders, automatically adjusting for different currencies, etc.. And finally he proposes the creation of multiple baskets in each country, so that there could be one that reflects the needs of senior citizens (who buy different stuff than young people) and one that reflects young homeowners and so forth.And he also envisions financial assets that are directly linked to a country\'s growth:And there could be a “trills” unit — a concept that Mark Kamstra of York University and I have been advocating — that represents one trillionth of a country’s most recently estimated annual G.D.P. There should also be a unit that grows or retreats with per-capita daily consumption. This could be used for pension and Social Security payments as a form of intergenerational risk-sharing: The idea is that payments to older people would rise and fall with overall consumption. With many kinds of baskets, it will be easier to set prices and make contracts that are sensible for the long term.With digitization, all of this should be possible, allowing us to keep what works in our modern financial system, and upgrading it to make it even better.None of this will satisfy Bitcoin believers – who believe in a totally different kind of innovation — but this is a good starting point to how the existing system of money can be built upon.Get the latest Bitcoin price here.>>', 'Nick Tomaino is currently on the business development team at Coinbase, and is also a first-year business school student at the Yale School of Management. Prior to that, he worked in venture capital, most recently for Softbank Capital.It is becoming increasingly clear to the public that Bitcoin is compelling for merchants as a more efficient payment processing option.But one question that is far from clear and will likely take longer to become apparent is: what are the consumer benefits to using the digital currency, outside of investment and speculation?Most mainstream consumers view bitcoin as a volatile asset that has no true benefit for consumers looking to spend on goods and services. In Senator Joe Manchin’s letter to the Treasury Department, he wrote:“Its deflationary trends ensure that only speculators such as so-called ‘Bitcoin miners’ will benefit from possessing the virtual currency.”This is a dangerous misconception that is often voiced by newcomers to bitcoin. While bitcoin is currently volatile and there are clear risks associated with it, there are also major benefits to spending bitcoin that are likely to become apparent as consumers learn more about the digital currency: cost savings, privacy, and ease of use.Cost savingsCost savings may ultimately be the most compelling benefit for bitcoin consumers.The cost savings on the merchant side are clear when you consider the interchange fees, assessment fees, chargeback fees and false declines that merchants currently incur by using existing payment methods.Ultimately, these fees are passed on to consumers, evidenced by the $0.75 fee you may pay for a transaction under $10.We’re already seeing large merchants pass the cost savings bitcoin brings on to consumers. Tiger Direct is currently offering $20 off all orders over $100. Fancy.com is currently offering a 25% off coupon on all bitcoin purchases until Sunday.These promotions are short term, but we expect many large merchants to offer long term discounts on bitcoin purchases in the near future.As these cost savings continue, consumers will soon realize that unlike credit cards companies, who cause merchants to price their goods higher and pass savings back to only a subset of the consumer base (credit card holders in the form of reward points), bitcoin enables lower prices for the masses.PrivacyPrivacy is on the minds of many US consumers right now, following the significant security breaches that occurred over the past few months at large retailers such as Target and Neiman Marcus.These security breaches highlight a fundamental difference between bitcoin and traditional online payment methods.Generally, when you pay for something online with a debit or credit card, you are giving that merchant personally identifiable information about yourself that is susceptible to theft.While tokenization techniques are becoming more commonly used by credit card companies, these techniques are still susceptible to error. The full details of the Target breach haven’t emerged yet but many believe that the perpetrator found a way to circumvent Target’s tokenization.When a consumer uses bitcoin to pay for goods or services online, they only share the public key and the amount of the payment with the merchant. There is no personally identifiable information shared that makes the consumer susceptible to identity theft.In order for a consumer’s funds to be used, the public key and private key must be obtained by the thief. For consumers that value privacy and want to prevent identify theft, bitcoin provides an alternative to existing payment options.Ease of useAnyone that has used a Coinbase wallet to make a purchase on Overstock, Fancy or any of our 25,000 merchants has likely recognized that our two-click check out process is a truly seamless buying experience.Paying in bitcoin eliminates the need to enter personal information and jump through additional verification hoops, steps which most existing payment methods require.Coinbase and other bitcoin companies provide what is arguably the most frictionless checkout experience on the internet.These three key benefits are likely to appeal to different consumers, and it is unclear which one will become the primary driver of long-term consumer adoption.When the consumer Internet became widespread, we couldn’t have imagined amazing services like Airbnb or Uber being built on top of it – we’re at a similar place with the Bitcoin network.Since Bitcoin is still in the early stages of its development, the benefits to consumers are myriad, and those listed above will be realized very soon. But as the technology matures and becomes ever more mainstream, the possibilities are endless.Follow Nick Tomaino on Twitter.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Đây là phản ứng đầu tiên của ngân hàng trung ương đối với đồng tiền ảo này.Cửa hàng cà phê đầu tiên chấp nhận thanh toán bằng Bitcoin ở Hà Nội cho biết vẫn tiếp tục nhận Bitcoin sau động thái của Ngân hàng Nhà nước. Ảnh: Thanh BìnhTrước đó hai ngày, sàn giao dịch Bitcoin lớn nhất nhì thế giới Mt Gox bất ngờ đóng cửa, khiến giới đầu tư trong đó có cả ở Việt Nam, thiệt hại hàng trăm triệu USD.Đa số những người đang nắm giữ Bitcoin hoặc tham gia cộng đồng này trong nước tỏ ra không quá lo lắng trước những tin tức nêu trên. ""Trước đó, cũng đã có một số nước đã tuyên bố chấp thuận Bitcoin, nhưng cũng có nhiều nơi không công nhận. Do đó, chúng tôi cũng xác định trước rằng mình buôn bán Bitcoin sẽ không được pháp luật bảo vệ và có rủi ro"", một người đào Bitcoin chuyên nghiệp cho biết.Anh Bùi Huy Kiên, chủ công ty đầu tiên tuyên bố chấp nhận thanh toán quảng cáo bằng Bitcoin cho biết sẽ có điều chỉnh nhất định. Trước đây anh trưng dòng chữ ""Chấp nhận thanh toán bằng Bitcoin"" lên diễn đàn của mình, bây giờ sẽ đổi thành ""Chấp nhận Bitcoin"", như là hàng đổi hàng.Còn tại một quán cà phê chấp nhận Bitcoin ở Hà Nội, chủ quán khẳng định không hạ biển ""Bitcoin accepted here"" (Ở đây nhận Bitcoin) xuống vì việc nhận đổi cốc cà phê bằng đồng này không phạm pháp.Anh Vương - một người am hiểu về Bitcoin nhận định quan điểm của cơ quan quản lý sẽ ảnh hưởng nhiều nhất những người muốn xây dựng Bitcoin thành một phương tiện thanh toán. Khi đó, những người đang muốn dùng Bitcoin để mua dịch vụ, sản phẩm sẽ trở nên ngần ngại.""Dẫu vậy, kể cả cấm trong nước, cơ quan quản lý cũng khó mà kiểm soát được"", anh Vương nói thêm. Thực tế hiện nay, nhà đầu tư Việt chủ yếu mua bán, giao dịch Bitcoin trên các sàn ở nước ngoài. Một số sàn lớn mà nhà đầu tư Việt đang tham gia giao dịch là Btc-e, Cryptsy, Bitfinex hay Localbitcoins...Biểu đồ giá Bitcoin trong 6 tháng vừa rồi.Giới chuyên gia trong nước đang có ý kiến trái chiều về tương lai của Bitcoin sau động thái của Ngân hàng Nhà nước. Thạc sĩ Nguyễn Phan Anh, giảng viên khoa Thương mại Điện tử - Đại học Thương mại cho rằng Bitcoin ở Việt Nam phát triển không chính thống, lại ảo về giá trị nên khó có thể lan rộng trong cộng đồng. Theo ông, trào lưu này sẽ lắng xuống khi các quy định chính thức được đưa ra. ""Nếu muốn ủng hộ thương mại điện tử Việt Nam hiện đại, tôi nghĩ cần ưu tiên phương thức giao dịch, thanh toán bằng tiền mặt hoặc các phương tiện có sẵn khác được Ngân hàng Nhà nước thừa nhận"", vị chuyên gia nhấn mạnh.Ngược lại, một chuyên gia về thương mại điện tử khác lại nhận định với nguyên tắc ngang hàng giữa người chơi với nhau thì không chỉ Bitcoin mà các đồng tiền ảo, điện tử khác như Litecoin, WMZ… sẽ tồn tại và khó có thể xóa sạch do chúng mang lại cơ hội lướt sóng cho một bộ phận người dùng Internet.Tin Ngân hàng Nhà nước cấm các tổ chức tín dụng dùng Bitcoin không làm giá cả mặt hàng này thay đổi, cả ở tiền Việt lẫn giá thế giới. Tính đến cuối hết tháng 2/2014, mỗi Bitcoin trên sàn Bitstamp có giá 551 USD, ngang ngửa đầu tuần. Giá này hạ khoảng 200 USD so với đầu năm, và giảm hơn một nửa so với thời đỉnh cao - có lúc lên 1.100 USD hồi cuối năm ngoái.Thanh Bình - Công Tâm']"

03/15/2014,"[""Perhaps the single most prominent, and telling, feature of bitcoin today is its massive controversy in the media. Not a single day goes by without an article or televised mention about its dangers, risks, and dubious mainstream appeal.Many in the mainstream seem set in their beliefs that bitcoin is a fad, or even worse a ponzi scheme, and is destined to fail. Yet when was the last time a ponzi scheme attracted global attention and prominent venture capital investment? Since when has a fad incited the simultaneous and largely hostile reactions of governments across the globe?Why did other payment technologies like PayPal or Western Union apparently fail to meet the requirements to be discussed in virtually every central bank on the planet, yet cryptocurrency is being so thoroughly scrutinised? Ironically enough, the on-going debate about whether or not bitcoin is truly a valuable disruptive technology, is all the evidence you need that it is.This is because bitcoin as a technology isn’t just challenging business models, or even an entire industry. Plenty of innovative outfits do that with much less flare. Bitcoin is challenging the financial infrastructure of the whole global economy, and even more, it is challenging entire generations of established political and economic theory that that infrastructure is built on.Bitcoin's exponential growth flouts all of the traditional monetary theory that is the mainstream ideology amongst academics and politicians today. Its very existence and growing success cannot be accounted for within these old paradigms.It challenges not only the basis and underlying assumptions of the modern financial system, but calls into question the beliefs and even livelihood of so many politicians, economic advisors, and media pundits. That is why so many are so sceptical of it, and others even outright hostile.Bitcoin the currencyAs a currency, bitcoin is in many ways the antithesis of modern fiat currencies. It has grown exponentially in usage the last year, and all without being declared by any state or central bank as “legal tender”. That simple fact astonishes many in academia, who could never have guessed a currency could spontaneously form and organically grow within the modern free market.It was something that was never even discussed theoretically, and is still taking time to sink in amidst the denials that bitcoin is here to stay.Yet this occurrence is surprisingly not entirely without precedence. Bitcoin is not the only example of a homogenous “good” being adopted by a population as a currency, for nothing but its underlying natural value and universal appeal. We have a much older example of that: gold, more than 5,000 years ago.Cryptocurrency is following the same path as precious metals in ancient civilization. Where gold was valued for its color, easy malleability, purity and its anti-corrosive properties, bitcoin is valued for it’s speed, decentralization, anonymity and ultra low transaction costs.Gold was discovered by practically every world civilization and became a good of such universal value it slowly became the de facto means of exchange (along with silver) across much of the planet, eventually culminating in the Classical Gold Standard. That is a span of dominance of thousands of years, compared with the 43 years of the global fiat system we have today.History thus clearly shows that the idea of a currency deriving value primarily from the “backing” of some central state is nonsense.For the vast majority of civilization, money was gold or silver, and both originated not as centrally issued currency that, as a result, magically had value, but as universally valued substances.Bitcoin is fast becoming the first commodity since gold to become a widely accepted means of exchange without the need of a central authority backing it.However unlike gold, Bitcoin is completely out of the reach of governments and can’t be regulated, centralized, or ultimately shut down and replaced with inflationary fiat money. For all its durability and timeless lustre, gold my pale to the longevity of a cryptocurrency system.Reacting to Big DataHowever Bitcoin is not just a currency that promises to eventually end the trend of patchwork national currencies that exist for the almost sole purpose of allowing governments to endlessly fund their own deficit spending.When the Internet was growing in the 90s it promised a future in which everyone everywhere had access to all the knowledge in the world, a future where technology ultimately empowered the individual.Indeed, this promise is coming closer and closer everyday as more people in underdeveloped countries have access to cheaper and cheaper smartphones and Internet access. However behind this positive outward development, the big players have long since been behind a much different trend.“Businesses will hopefully creatively utilize the open source design of Bitcoin to provide entirely secure and anonymous end-to-end experiences.”Google, Facebook, as well as many others, all keep meticulous track of user data for advertising and other purposes. On several occasions, the massive amounts of data collected by Internet service and telecommunications companies have been utilized by agencies such as the NSA, under morally questionable motives at best.The result is a system that has evolved with the ability to track everything you do, like, go, and know, and then provide all of that data to one central authority you may or may not trust, all with little choice for the consumer. The Internet has recently been more reminiscent of Orwell’s 1984, rather than the future of individual empowerment that was promised.Cryptocurrency is the first major technological advancement that, intentionally or not, is a massive reaction to the trend of Big Data. It is decentralized and anonymous by design, and it is these key features within the Bitcoin protocol itself that may be the key to weakening the hold of massive data collecting service companies like Google.Already, all payments with Bitcoin are anonymous, which could allow users to opt out of advertising with anonymous micropayments. Yet many other cryptocurrencies such as Namecoin are attempting to take the protocol that enables this and use it to build other decentralized networks.Among these can be email, domain names, and other such systems.Decentralized applicationsThis is only the beginning however, businesses will hopefully creatively utilize the open source design of Bitcoin to provide entirely secure and anonymous end-to-end experiences. The possibilities for the emerging wave of decentralized applications are endless, and only time will tell what it does result in. As David Johnston, the $1m sponsor of the Austin Bitcoin Hackathon put it:“[Decentralized applications] have the potential to become self-sustaining because they empower their stakeholders to invest in the development of the DA. Because of that, it is conceivable that DAs for payments, social networking, and cloud computing may one day surpass the valuation of multinational corporations like Western Union, Visa, Facebook, Google, and Amazon that are are currently active in the space.”At the very least, the ever-growing success of bitcoin thus far candidly illustrates that there is indeed a massive demand for anonymity online, one companies would be wise to take advantage of.It’s far too tempting to compare bitcoin to PCs, the Internet, or even to gold 5,000 years ago. While it does possess similarities with many of these things, and comparing it to such landmark achievements underscores its importance, bitcoin is it’s own phenomena.PCs may have had a huge amount of industry leaders shrugging it off or denouncing it entirely like bitcoin does now, but it never had whole governments attempting to shut down or regulate its use.Precious metals may have been the first and last good to become universally adopted as a means of exchange, but this was a slow process that took centuries if not millennia, whereas the usage of cryptocurrencies has exploded in just a few short years.While bitcoin may have many old conceptual roots, it is altogether new and powerful. It is ushering in a new paradigm in various aspects of society, and creating a new benchmark for future technological achievements to inevitably be compared to.Bitcoin is changing everything, and if you aren’t on board, then you’re already a dinosaur.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He is involved with Canadian and international counsel in the developing area of virtual currency law, specifically including bitcoin currency.One of the most frustrating things I encounter when being retained by a new client or working with an existing client operating in the bitcoin space is that without exception, I have the unfortunate task of advising them that as it stands now in Canada, the chances of them obtaining a regular commercial services based bank account are 0%.“Canada is an attractive environment for bitcoin entities to set up operations”Sometimes this is a non-starter and the bitcoin entity makes the decision to set up operations in another country, which is extremely unfortunate for a variety of reasons, including the economic loss to Canada derived from losing a potential new Canadian business and the more important loss to the potential client in regards to their bitcoin business.This is a shame, because, as I have previously mentioned on CoinDesk, Canada is an attractive environment for bitcoin entities to set up operations since our country does not have, for example, the state-by-state money transmitting regulations that currently exist in the US.Businesses need banksWithout basic commercial banking services, most bitcoin businesses would have a tough time operating, as businesses in general often need, as an example, the ability to deposit money somewhere and require some level of online banking.I have personally spoken with presidents and senior vice-presidents of major Canadian banking institutions and credit unions, and the impressions I get can be summed up as follows:(a) Banks are still in the process of figuring out what bitcoin is and how to deal with it, since it is a disruptive technology which could arguably compete with the bank’s own existing services and products (although no banking executives on my calls explicitly mentioned the competition concern).(b) Banks are apprehensive about boarding new bitcoin clients because Canada’s federal government, via the Department of Finance, has yet to introduce regulations which specifically target bitcoin and digital currency operations.(c) Banks are apprehensive about boarding bitcoin entities over concerns related to money laundering activities which could be carried out by their newly boarded digital currency clients.Guidance lackingAs mentioned in section (b) above, Canadian bitcoin entities are presently victims of a ‘catch 22’ type of situation: they are caught in a situation from which they cannot escape because they are subject to arbitrary banking rules and the lack of Canadian legislation, which effectively places them in a situation in which they have no control over.Buried on page 134 of the 419-page recently released Canadian 2014 Federal Budget, the Canadian federal government confirms that it will “introduce anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regulations for virtual currencies, such as bitcoin”.OK, so regulations will be introduced by the Canadian government which will specifically address bitcoin, which would, in my opinion, put Canadian banks and credit unions at least partially at ease as per (b) above, but when are these regulations going to be announced and come into effect?There has been absolutely no guidance from the federal government on this issue. It could be next week or it could be in six months. In the meantime, bitcoin entities are caught in this unfortunate ‘catch 22’ predicament.Banking hypocrisy?An issue which deserves some serious attention is the way that both Canadian and international banks execute their anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regulations.It’s great that banks have anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing policies, but often the execution of those policies are abhorrent and sloppy at best.Case in point, in an article published by elitedaily.com on February 21st 2014, entitled 'The Ugly Truth Behind Major Banks Financing Mexico’s Drug Cartels', the author noted that:“Since 2006, more than a dozen banks have reached settlements with the Justice Department (United States) as restitution for violations related to money laundering. American Express Bank International admitted to processing more than $55 million in drug money that had been laundered through offshore shell accounts that it operates.”Readers may recall that last December, the British bank HSBC (which has a large Canadian presence) agreed to settle with the US Justice Department to pay approximately $2 billion in penalties for having moved $881 million in drug proceeds from cartels in Mexico and Columbia during a recent five-year period.Arguments have been made that banks in general often do not face criminal prosecution for violating anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regulations, but instead, according to the author of the aforementioned article referred to above, “(accept) settlements that either defer or erase the threat of criminal suits.”If this is true, it can be argued that there is little incentive for banks to actually toughen internal regulatory compliance.There have been instances of senior bank executives leaving their positions at their respective banks because of this lack of internal regulatory compliance.For example, in the aforementioned article, reference is made to a gentlemen named Martin Woods, who served as director of Wachovia’s anti-money laundering unit in London for three years before leaving his position ‘in disgust’ after his repeated requests to executives to put a stop to ongoing drug money laundering operations, which were allegedly occurring in Wachovia’s branch network, were ignored).Ignored issueCanadian and international banks take the position that they won’t board bitcoin clients because of concerns that bitcoin entities could be used to facilitate drug money laundering activities. At the same time as a result of sloppy execution some of these banks are guilty themselves of facilitating drug money laundering activities and as a result have paid billion dollar settlement fines.Is this hypocrisy? At a minimum it appears to be an inconsistent application of anti-money laundering policies internally versus externally to bitcoin clients.I believe that the mainstream media, when discussing bitcoin and the risk of money laundering activities associated with it, fails to consider or comment on the hypocrisy issue discussed above. This is most unfortunate.HSBC image via Northfoto / Shutterstock.com. eBanking and 'catch 22' images via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Specifically, the UK-division of the massive company.The news comes from the service’s Facebook page in which a user asked the following:Hi Just-Eat, I would love to pay with Bitcoin for my food. Are you implementing this? Services such as www.bips.me or www.bitpay.com can handle the bitcoins for you and just pay you in sterling, euros, or dollars in your bank account.In the response, Just-Eat.co.uk said:We’re looking into Bitcoin. We’ll keep you all posted.Just so you’re aware (if you’re from the United States like I am), Just-Eat operates in 13 countries including Canada, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Italy, and France.Founded in 2001, the service brings in £700 million in revenue annually for the restaurant industry, and has received upwards of 100 million orders since launch.At present time, about 36,000 restaurants are signed up with the service across all countries.It should be made clear that in this particular case, only the UK operation seems to be looking into bitcoin acceptance. There hasn’t been word from the corporate office, so far as we’re aware.Still, assuming Just-Eat in the UK does enable bitcoin payments, we suspect our friends across the pond will be very happy indeed.', 'PhotoThe best thing that happened to PayPal in years may also be why it has turned into a Wall Street football: a big upswing in innovation, fed by the prospect of irrelevance.About two years ago, “We recognized we needed” a shake-up, said James Barrese, the company’s chief technical officer. “We’d taken our eyes off the ball.” New ways of thinking about payments and money itself by competitors, he added, “just increased the urgency.”As a result, last year PayPal added 58 products, compared with one new product in 2012. The company is thinking harder about how to make easy transactions for small business, the province of Square; about mobile payments, as Google’s Wallet has sought for Android; and about frictionless, secure cross-border transactions, like those promised by Bitcoin.That rush of activity may also be why the billionaire financier Carl C. Icahn has been on a campaign for eBay, which bought PayPal in 2002, to sell PayPal. Mr. Icahn has called John J. Donahoe, eBay’s chief executive, “either incompetent or negligent” for the way he has treated PayPal.Mr. Donahoe, in a recent interview, said Mr. Icahn does not sufficiently appreciate that “there is a convergence of payments and marketplaces” in phenomena like Square, Google Wallet and Amazon’s “one click” payments method.“Good payments make paying go away,” he said. “PayPal competes by taking the friction out — online, with mobile and, increasingly, offline.” In effect, he said, the rise of PayPal and the rise of eBay need to remain coupled.Several former PayPal executives have weighed in on whether the company should again be independent. Elon Musk and David Sacks have both been quoted as saying that autonomy would spur PayPal to increase its value. Reid Hoffman, who like the other two helped build PayPal, has written a thorough blog post that backs up Mr. Donahoe’s point about payment technologies and markets converging. It also supports Mr. Barrese’s point about PayPal becoming a technology platform based on payments.Certainly, the technology push at PayPal supports the idea of moving to put the service in more areas. In the last two years, roughly the time Mr. Barrese has been in his current job, the electronic payments company has changed about 40 percent of its contract and employee labor force. The company also introduced important technology changes that affect the speed at which it can create products and the number of mobile platforms it can easily reach.PhotoPerhaps more important, the company has modified its ideas about technology, money and payments to put PayPal in as many places as possible. PayPal’s purchase in September of Braintree also got it Venmo, a popular mobile payments company.On the longer term, Mr. Barrese said, “We want a platform strategy of a wallet in the cloud that takes any operating system, any credit card and any consumer” device. And he wants many more outside developers to build products for PayPal, including loyalty cards with novel uses, easy money transfers between people and new types of authentication, similar to the recently announced fingerprint authentication for PayPal that Samsung put on its Galaxy S5 phone.“We could authenticate any wearable device,” Mr. Barrese said. “In our labs, we have technology to identify you from your heart rate or your voice. Passwords will go away for more reliable systems.” He has also been testing payments using the inexpensive Raspberry Pi operating system, so that people could pay at the (smart) door to get into a movie.What will not go away, Mr. Barrese said, is governments and their desire to regulate and tax payments. Bitcoin, he said, “is one of those things we’re watching, to see how it develops.”He added: “But in any financial system, they want oversight. The reality is, countries don’t want to let go of laws like anti-money-laundering or antiterrorism.” PayPal, which works in 26 currencies and 197 countries, he said, “is the only way for a new product or solution to go global fast.”Possibly, though by some counts Bitcoin’s daily transactions can rival PayPal’s, if not in number, then in total value. Given the urgency PayPal is feeling, that may not last. If so, Mr. Donahue and Mr. Barrese may want to thank Square, Google and the other competitors. Even Mr. Icahn — someday, maybe.', 'Arquivo pessoal O cartomante Dênis Maapelli, 35, diz que nove entre dez atendimento que faz são via SkypeUma das tradições mais antigas em cartomancia, a leitura de baralho cigano ganhou uma versão tecnologicamente ""atualizada"" com o trabalho de um brasileiro. Morador de Porto Alegre (RS), o cartomante tem um blog, atende clientes usando o Skype e até aceita pagamento em bitcoin, moeda digital em popularização no mundo.Dênis Maapelli, 35, diz que há cinco anos estuda e lê o baralho cigano. Ele afirma ter resolvido criar a versão online do serviço pela praticidade em atender clientes de outras cidades dentro e fora do Brasil.""Tenho uma grande demanda de clientes do Nordeste brasileiro e de Portugal, principalmente em Lisboa e Porto"", detalha. A repaginada ""digital"" à leitura do baralho cigano já faz com que nove entre dez atendimentos feitos por ele sejam online.Além do atendimento via internet, Maapelli disponibiliza formas de pagamento online aos clientes como pelo PayPal e com bitcoins. Ele diz que conheceu a moeda virtual por uma reportagem e decidiu investir o equivalente a R$ 50 em dezembro. Com a valorização dos bitcoins, ele conta que conseguiu acumular R$ 250.""Passei a aceitar pagamentos em bitcoin porque às vezes um cliente tem pressa para que eu abra as cartas, o que eu faço só depois de receber a confirmação de pagamento. Com a moeda virtual, essa confirmação ocorre rápido, em uns 15 minutos, sem burocracia ou taxas"", explica.Até o momento, apenas uma cliente fez o pagamento com a moeda virtual. ""Ela não tem cartão internacional e sempre enfrentava problemas para pagar. Agora ela compra bitcoins lá e eu recebo na minha carteira virtual aqui.""A desvantagem, avalia o cartomante, é que muitas pessoas ainda não confiam nos bitcoins como um meio seguro de pagamento. ""Ainda falta informação e, como não é algo que a pessoal consegue ver, como uma nota de dinheiro, muitos clientes meus desconfiam da validade dos bitcoins.""Consulta via SkypeCom o atendimento por videochamada, Maapelli diz ter uma flexibilidade maior para agendar horários e acaba conquistando clientes que desejam privacidade. ""Se a pessoa precisar, posso atendê-la, por exemplo, às onze da noite. Também há casos de clientes que têm receio de se expor comparecendo pessoalmente, então o Skype é uma forma mais discreta para atendê-los.""Durante a abertura do baralho cigano, o cartomante vai respondendo às perguntas feitas pelo consulente. ""É como um tratamento terapêutico. Há muitas informações que estão no inconsciente da pessoa, mas ela não consegue perceber e o baralho acaba indicando"", diz.Como no atendimento online o cliente não manuseia o baralho, Maapelli pede para a pessoa se concentrar enquanto ele embaralha e tira as cartas, para que haja ""uma troca de energia constante"", próxima à do atendimento presencial.']","[""Perhaps the single most prominent, and telling, feature of bitcoin today is its massive controversy in the media.

Since when has a fad incited the simultaneous and largely hostile reactions of governments across the globe?Why did other payment technologies like PayPal or Western Union apparently fail to meet the requirements to be discussed in virtually every central bank on the planet, yet cryptocurrency is being so thoroughly scrutinised? Ironically enough, the on-going debate about whether or not bitcoin is truly a valuable disruptive technology, is all the evidence you need that it is.This is because bitcoin as a technology isn’t just challenging business models, or even an entire industry. Plenty of innovative outfits do that with much less flare. Bitcoin is challenging the financial infrastructure of the whole global economy, and even more, it is challenging entire generations of established political and economic theory that that infrastructure is built on.Bitcoin's exponential growth flouts all of the traditional monetary theory that is the mainstream ideology amongst academics and politicians today. Its very existence and growing success cannot be accounted for within these old paradigms.It challenges not only the basis and underlying assumptions of the modern financial system, but calls into question the beliefs and even livelihood of so many politicians, economic advisors, and media pundits. That is why so many are so sceptical of it, and others even outright hostile.Bitcoin the currencyAs a currency, bitcoin is in many ways the antithesis of modern fiat currencies. It has grown exponentially in usage the last year, and all without being declared by any state or central bank as “legal tender”. That simple fact astonishes many in academia, who could never have guessed a currency could spontaneously form and organically grow within the modern free market.It was something that was never even discussed theoretically, and is still taking time to sink in amidst the denials that bitcoin is here to stay.Yet this occurrence is surprisingly not entirely without precedence. Bitcoin is not the only example of a homogenous “good” being adopted by a population as a currency, for nothing but its underlying natural value and universal appeal. We have a much older example of that: gold, more than 5,000 years ago.Cryptocurrency is following the same path as precious metals in ancient civilization. Where gold was valued for its color, easy malleability, purity and its anti-corrosive properties, bitcoin is valued for it’s speed, decentralization, anonymity and ultra low transaction costs.Gold was discovered by practically every world civilization and became a good of such universal value it slowly became the de facto means of exchange (along with silver) across much of the planet, eventually culminating in the Classical Gold Standard. That is a span of dominance of thousands of years, compared with the 43 years of the global fiat system we have today.History thus clearly shows that the idea of a currency deriving value primarily from the “backing” of some central state is nonsense.For the vast majority of civilization, money was gold or silver, and both originated not as centrally issued currency that, as a result, magically had value, but as universally valued substances.Bitcoin is fast becoming the first commodity since gold to become a widely accepted means of exchange without the need of a central authority backing it.However unlike gold, Bitcoin is completely out of the reach of governments and can’t be regulated, centralized, or ultimately shut down and replaced with inflationary fiat money. For all its durability and timeless lustre, gold my pale to the longevity of a cryptocurrency system.Reacting to Big DataHowever Bitcoin is not just a currency that promises to eventually end the trend of patchwork national currencies that exist for the almost sole purpose of allowing governments to endlessly fund their own deficit spending.When the Internet was growing in the 90s it promised a future in which everyone everywhere had access to all the knowledge in the world, a future where technology ultimately empowered the individual.Indeed, this promise is coming closer and closer everyday as more people in underdeveloped countries have access to cheaper and cheaper smartphones and Internet access. However behind this positive outward development, the big players have long since been behind a much different trend.“Businesses will hopefully creatively utilize the open source design of Bitcoin to provide entirely secure and anonymous end-to-end experiences.”Google, Facebook, as well as many others, all keep meticulous track of user data for advertising and other purposes. On several occasions, the massive amounts of data collected by Internet service and telecommunications companies have been utilized by agencies such as the NSA, under morally questionable motives at best.The result is a system that has evolved with the ability to track everything you do, like, go, and know, and then provide all of that data to one central authority you may or may not trust, all with little choice for the consumer. The Internet has recently been more reminiscent of Orwell’s 1984, rather than the future of individual empowerment that was promised.Cryptocurrency is the first major technological advancement that, intentionally or not, is a massive reaction to the trend of Big Data. It is decentralized and anonymous by design, and it is these key features within the Bitcoin protocol itself that may be the key to weakening the hold of massive data collecting service companies like Google.Already, all payments with Bitcoin are anonymous, which could allow users to opt out of advertising with anonymous micropayments. Yet many other cryptocurrencies such as Namecoin are attempting to take the protocol that enables this and use it to build other decentralized networks.Among these can be email, domain names, and other such systems.Decentralized applicationsThis is only the beginning however, businesses will hopefully creatively utilize the open source design of Bitcoin to provide entirely secure and anonymous end-to-end experiences. The possibilities for the emerging wave of decentralized applications are endless, and only time will tell what it does result in. As David Johnston, the $1m sponsor of the Austin Bitcoin Hackathon put it:“[Decentralized applications] have the potential to become self-sustaining because they empower their stakeholders to invest in the development of the DA. Because of that, it is conceivable that DAs for payments, social networking, and cloud computing may one day surpass the valuation of multinational corporations like Western Union, Visa, Facebook, Google, and Amazon that are are currently active in the space.”At the very least, the ever-growing success of bitcoin thus far candidly illustrates that there is indeed a massive demand for anonymity online, one companies would be wise to take advantage of.It’s far too tempting to compare bitcoin to PCs, the Internet, or even to gold 5,000 years ago. While it does possess similarities with many of these things, and comparing it to such landmark achievements underscores its importance, bitcoin is it’s own phenomena.PCs may have had a huge amount of industry leaders shrugging it off or denouncing it entirely like bitcoin does now, but it never had whole governments attempting to shut down or regulate its use.Precious metals may have been the first and last good to become universally adopted as a means of exchange, but this was a slow process that took centuries if not millennia, whereas the usage of cryptocurrencies has exploded in just a few short years.While bitcoin may have many old conceptual roots, it is altogether new and powerful. It is ushering in a new paradigm in various aspects of society, and creating a new benchmark for future technological achievements to inevitably be compared to.Bitcoin is changing everything, and if you aren’t on board, then you’re already a dinosaur.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He is involved with Canadian and international counsel in the developing area of virtual currency law, specifically including bitcoin currency.One of the most frustrating things I encounter when being retained by a new client or working with an existing client operating in the bitcoin space is that without exception, I have the unfortunate task of advising them that as it stands now in Canada, the chances of them obtaining a regular commercial services based bank account are 0%.“Canada is an attractive environment for bitcoin entities to set up operations”Sometimes this is a non-starter and the bitcoin entity makes the decision to set up operations in another country, which is extremely unfortunate for a variety of reasons, including the economic loss to Canada derived from losing a potential new Canadian business and the more important loss to the potential client in regards to their bitcoin business.This is a shame, because, as I have previously mentioned on CoinDesk, Canada is an attractive environment for bitcoin entities to set up operations since our country does not have, for example, the state-by-state money transmitting regulations that currently exist in the US.Businesses need banksWithout basic commercial banking services, most bitcoin businesses would have a tough time operating, as businesses in general often need, as an example, the ability to deposit money somewhere and require some level of online banking.I have personally spoken with presidents and senior vice-presidents of major Canadian banking institutions and credit unions, and the impressions I get can be summed up as follows:(a) Banks are still in the process of figuring out what bitcoin is and how to deal with it, since it is a disruptive technology which could arguably compete with the bank’s own existing services and products (although no banking executives on my calls explicitly mentioned the competition concern).(b) Banks are apprehensive about boarding new bitcoin clients because Canada’s federal government, via the Department of Finance, has yet to introduce regulations which specifically target bitcoin and digital currency operations.(c) Banks are apprehensive about boarding bitcoin entities over concerns related to money laundering activities which could be carried out by their newly boarded digital currency clients.Guidance lackingAs mentioned in section (b) above, Canadian bitcoin entities are presently victims of a ‘catch 22’ type of situation: they are caught in a situation from which they cannot escape because they are subject to arbitrary banking rules and the lack of Canadian legislation, which effectively places them in a situation in which they have no control over.Buried on page 134 of the 419-page recently released Canadian 2014 Federal Budget, the Canadian federal government confirms that it will “introduce anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regulations for virtual currencies, such as bitcoin”.OK, so regulations will be introduced by the Canadian government which will specifically address bitcoin, which would, in my opinion, put Canadian banks and credit unions at least partially at ease as per (b) above, but when are these regulations going to be announced and come into effect?There has been absolutely no guidance from the federal government on this issue. It could be next week or it could be in six months. In the meantime, bitcoin entities are caught in this unfortunate ‘catch 22’ predicament.Banking hypocrisy?An issue which deserves some serious attention is the way that both Canadian and international banks execute their anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regulations.It’s great that banks have anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing policies, but often the execution of those policies are abhorrent and sloppy at best.Case in point, in an article published by elitedaily.com on February 21st 2014, entitled 'The Ugly Truth Behind Major Banks Financing Mexico’s Drug Cartels', the author noted that:“Since 2006, more than a dozen banks have reached settlements with the Justice Department (United States) as restitution for violations related to money laundering. American Express Bank International admitted to processing more than $55 million in drug money that had been laundered through offshore shell accounts that it operates.”Readers may recall that last December, the British bank HSBC (which has a large Canadian presence) agreed to settle with the US Justice Department to pay approximately $2 billion in penalties for having moved $881 million in drug proceeds from cartels in Mexico and Columbia during a recent five-year period.Arguments have been made that banks in general often do not face criminal prosecution for violating anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regulations, but instead, according to the author of the aforementioned article referred to above, “(accept) settlements that either defer or erase the threat of criminal suits.”If this is true, it can be argued that there is little incentive for banks to actually toughen internal regulatory compliance.There have been instances of senior bank executives leaving their positions at their respective banks because of this lack of internal regulatory compliance.For example, in the aforementioned article, reference is made to a gentlemen named Martin Woods, who served as director of Wachovia’s anti-money laundering unit in London for three years before leaving his position ‘in disgust’ after his repeated requests to executives to put a stop to ongoing drug money laundering operations, which were allegedly occurring in Wachovia’s branch network, were ignored).Ignored issueCanadian and international banks take the position that they won’t board bitcoin clients because of concerns that bitcoin entities could be used to facilitate drug money laundering activities. At the same time as a result of sloppy execution some of these banks are guilty themselves of facilitating drug money laundering activities and as a result have paid billion dollar settlement fines.Is this hypocrisy? At a minimum it appears to be an inconsistent application of anti-money laundering policies internally versus externally to bitcoin clients.I believe that the mainstream media, when discussing bitcoin and the risk of money laundering activities associated with it, fails to consider or comment on the hypocrisy issue discussed above. This is most unfortunate.HSBC image via Northfoto / Shutterstock.com. eBanking and 'catch 22' images via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Specifically, the UK-division of the massive company.The news comes from the service’s Facebook page in which a user asked the following:Hi Just-Eat, I would love to pay with Bitcoin for my food. Are you implementing this? Services such as www.bips.me or www.bitpay.com can handle the bitcoins for you and just pay you in sterling, euros, or dollars in your bank account.In the response, Just-Eat.co.uk said:We’re looking into Bitcoin. We’ll keep you all posted.Just so you’re aware (if you’re from the United States like I am), Just-Eat operates in 13 countries including Canada, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Italy, and France.Founded in 2001, the service brings in £700 million in revenue annually for the restaurant industry, and has received upwards of 100 million orders since launch.At present time, about 36,000 restaurants are signed up with the service across all countries.It should be made clear that in this particular case, only the UK operation seems to be looking into bitcoin acceptance. There hasn’t been word from the corporate office, so far as we’re aware.Still, assuming Just-Eat in the UK does enable bitcoin payments, we suspect our friends across the pond will be very happy indeed.', 'PhotoThe best thing that happened to PayPal in years may also be why it has turned into a Wall Street football: a big upswing in innovation, fed by the prospect of irrelevance.About two years ago, “We recognized we needed” a shake-up, said James Barrese, the company’s chief technical officer. “We’d taken our eyes off the ball.” New ways of thinking about payments and money itself by competitors, he added, “just increased the urgency.”As a result, last year PayPal added 58 products, compared with one new product in 2012. The company is thinking harder about how to make easy transactions for small business, the province of Square; about mobile payments, as Google’s Wallet has sought for Android; and about frictionless, secure cross-border transactions, like those promised by Bitcoin.That rush of activity may also be why the billionaire financier Carl C. Icahn has been on a campaign for eBay, which bought PayPal in 2002, to sell PayPal. Mr. Icahn has called John J. Donahoe, eBay’s chief executive, “either incompetent or negligent” for the way he has treated PayPal.Mr. Donahoe, in a recent interview, said Mr. Icahn does not sufficiently appreciate that “there is a convergence of payments and marketplaces” in phenomena like Square, Google Wallet and Amazon’s “one click” payments method.“Good payments make paying go away,” he said. “PayPal competes by taking the friction out — online, with mobile and, increasingly, offline.” In effect, he said, the rise of PayPal and the rise of eBay need to remain coupled.Several former PayPal executives have weighed in on whether the company should again be independent. Elon Musk and David Sacks have both been quoted as saying that autonomy would spur PayPal to increase its value. Reid Hoffman, who like the other two helped build PayPal, has written a thorough blog post that backs up Mr. Donahoe’s point about payment technologies and markets converging. It also supports Mr. Barrese’s point about PayPal becoming a technology platform based on payments.Certainly, the technology push at PayPal supports the idea of moving to put the service in more areas. In the last two years, roughly the time Mr. Barrese has been in his current job, the electronic payments company has changed about 40 percent of its contract and employee labor force. The company also introduced important technology changes that affect the speed at which it can create products and the number of mobile platforms it can easily reach.PhotoPerhaps more important, the company has modified its ideas about technology, money and payments to put PayPal in as many places as possible. PayPal’s purchase in September of Braintree also got it Venmo, a popular mobile payments company.On the longer term, Mr. Barrese said, “We want a platform strategy of a wallet in the cloud that takes any operating system, any credit card and any consumer” device. And he wants many more outside developers to build products for PayPal, including loyalty cards with novel uses, easy money transfers between people and new types of authentication, similar to the recently announced fingerprint authentication for PayPal that Samsung put on its Galaxy S5 phone.“We could authenticate any wearable device,” Mr. Barrese said. “In our labs, we have technology to identify you from your heart rate or your voice. Passwords will go away for more reliable systems.” He has also been testing payments using the inexpensive Raspberry Pi operating system, so that people could pay at the (smart) door to get into a movie.What will not go away, Mr. Barrese said, is governments and their desire to regulate and tax payments. Bitcoin, he said, “is one of those things we’re watching, to see how it develops.”He added: “But in any financial system, they want oversight. The reality is, countries don’t want to let go of laws like anti-money-laundering or antiterrorism.” PayPal, which works in 26 currencies and 197 countries, he said, “is the only way for a new product or solution to go global fast.”Possibly, though by some counts Bitcoin’s daily transactions can rival PayPal’s, if not in number, then in total value. Given the urgency PayPal is feeling, that may not last. If so, Mr. Donahue and Mr. Barrese may want to thank Square, Google and the other competitors. Even Mr. Icahn — someday, maybe.', 'Arquivo pessoal O cartomante Dênis Maapelli, 35, diz que nove entre dez atendimento que faz são via SkypeUma das tradições mais antigas em cartomancia, a leitura de baralho cigano ganhou uma versão tecnologicamente ""atualizada"" com o trabalho de um brasileiro. Morador de Porto Alegre (RS), o cartomante tem um blog, atende clientes usando o Skype e até aceita pagamento em bitcoin, moeda digital em popularização no mundo.Dênis Maapelli, 35, diz que há cinco anos estuda e lê o baralho cigano. Ele afirma ter resolvido criar a versão online do serviço pela praticidade em atender clientes de outras cidades dentro e fora do Brasil.""Tenho uma grande demanda de clientes do Nordeste brasileiro e de Portugal, principalmente em Lisboa e Porto"", detalha. A repaginada ""digital"" à leitura do baralho cigano já faz com que nove entre dez atendimentos feitos por ele sejam online.Além do atendimento via internet, Maapelli disponibiliza formas de pagamento online aos clientes como pelo PayPal e com bitcoins. Ele diz que conheceu a moeda virtual por uma reportagem e decidiu investir o equivalente a R$ 50 em dezembro. Com a valorização dos bitcoins, ele conta que conseguiu acumular R$ 250.""Passei a aceitar pagamentos em bitcoin porque às vezes um cliente tem pressa para que eu abra as cartas, o que eu faço só depois de receber a confirmação de pagamento. Com a moeda virtual, essa confirmação ocorre rápido, em uns 15 minutos, sem burocracia ou taxas"", explica.Até o momento, apenas uma cliente fez o pagamento com a moeda virtual. ""Ela não tem cartão internacional e sempre enfrentava problemas para pagar. Agora ela compra bitcoins lá e eu recebo na minha carteira virtual aqui.""A desvantagem, avalia o cartomante, é que muitas pessoas ainda não confiam nos bitcoins como um meio seguro de pagamento. ""Ainda falta informação e, como não é algo que a pessoal consegue ver, como uma nota de dinheiro, muitos clientes meus desconfiam da validade dos bitcoins.""Consulta via SkypeCom o atendimento por videochamada, Maapelli diz ter uma flexibilidade maior para agendar horários e acaba conquistando clientes que desejam privacidade. ""Se a pessoa precisar, posso atendê-la, por exemplo, às onze da noite. Também há casos de clientes que têm receio de se expor comparecendo pessoalmente, então o Skype é uma forma mais discreta para atendê-los.""Durante a abertura do baralho cigano, o cartomante vai respondendo às perguntas feitas pelo consulente. ""É como um tratamento terapêutico. Há muitas informações que estão no inconsciente da pessoa, mas ela não consegue perceber e o baralho acaba indicando"", diz.Como no atendimento online o cliente não manuseia o baralho, Maapelli pede para a pessoa se concentrar enquanto ele embaralha e tira as cartas, para que haja ""uma troca de energia constante"", próxima à do atendimento presencial.']"

03/22/2014,"['Drop whatever you’re doing and go read Maciej Cegłowski’s absolutely magnificent essay Our Comrade The Electron, an astonishing history of the amazing Russian engineer Lev Sergeyevich Termen. Make sure you read right down to its punchline, “the most badass answer imaginable.” But if time is short, or you struggle to read English, please at least read its angry rant, from which I quote:Technology concentrates power. In the 90’s, it looked like the Internet might be an exception, that it could be a decentralizing, democratizing force … but those days are gone … What upsets me, what really gets my goat, is that we did it because it was the easiest thing to do … Making things ephemeral is hard. Making things distributed is hard. Making things anonymous is hard. Coming up with a sane business model is really hard—I get tired just thinking about it. We put so much care into making the Internet resilient from technical failures, but make no effort to make it resilient to political failure. We treat freedom and the rule of law like inexhaustible natural resources, rather than the fragile and precious treasures that they are. And now, of course, it’s time to make the Internet of Things, where we will connect everything to everything else, and build cool apps on top, and nothing can possibly go wrong.He’s right. And so the Internet has, for most intents and purposes, evolved into a landscape dominated by centralized systems, epitomized by what Bruce Sterling calls the Stacks — Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft. To quote, er, myself:They don’t want much, those Stacks. Just your identity, your allegiance, and all of your data. Just to be your sole provider of messaging, media, merchandise, and metadata. Just to take part in as much of your online existence as they possibly can, and maybe to one day mediate your every interaction with the world around you, online or off.The Stacks exist in part because less centralized systems are extremely difficult to build. Consider, for instance, Google+ architect Yonatan Zunger’s explanation of “distributed consensus,” i.e. the means by which data can be safely preserved in distributed systems with multiple editors. It’s absolutely brilliant — but none of its 8,000 words are wasted. The gold-standard “Paxos” algorithm is sufficiently complex that a pair of Stanford engineers recently published a paper entitled “In Search Of An Understandable Consensus Algorithm” (PDF) — the title of which sums up the state of the art nicely — in which they present a new alternative, “Raft.”Distributed algorithms, distributed data, distributed systems, distributed security: messy, tricky, complicated, a maze of vibrating tightropes stretched across an N-dimensional pit full of hungry failure modes with sharp teeth. Hard stuff.But not impossible.Just ask Satoshi Nakamoto.Beyond the hype and the greed, Bitcoin is powered by a genuine technical breakthrough(1), to a degree I did not properly appreciate when I first started writing about it. The “blockchain” — the engine on which Bitcoin is built — is a new kind of distributed consensus system that allows transactions, or other data, to be securely stored and verified without any centralized authority at all, because (to grossly oversimplify) they are validated by the entire network. Those transactions don’t have to be financial; that data doesn’t have to be money. The engine that powers Bitcoin can be used for a whole array of other applications…Currently at 89 categories of things that can be placed on blockchain. Not bad BTC-Twitter for 3 hours work. :) http://t.co/jf56nPNDqM — Antonis Polemitis (@polemitis) March 12, 2014…with one huge caveat. As Michael Nielsen puts it, in his excellent, detailed explanation of how Bitcoin actually works:For [the blockchain] to have any chance of succeeding, network users need an incentive to help validate transactions. Without such an incentive, they have no reason to expend valuable computational power, merely to help validate other people’s transactions. And if network users are not willing to expend that power, then the whole system won’t work. The solution to this problem is to reward people who help validate transactions.Satoshi Nakamoto’s genius was twofold; technically, he built the world’s first(1) blockchain; socially, he lured people into powering it, using good old filthy lucre as an incentive. Which was very effective, but is now also a little awkward, as Bitcoin-as-a-currency has attracted a large number of … er … let’s diplomatically call them “colorful personalities,” and also, money-as-a-store-of-value is one field where in fact you probably do want some centralized authority, or at least insurance. I agree with the mordant observations on Twitter that it’s highly amusing watching the extremist fringes of the Bitcoin community slowly rediscover from first principles exactly why financial regulation exists in the first place.Meanwhile, though, the noise and smoke of the ongoing endless (and endlessly entertaining) Bitcoin sturm und drang has — ironically — obscured its real breakthrough; the blockchain.You see, it’s not that hard to imagine other blockchain-based systems which aren’t currencies and don’t attract as many “colorful personalities.” Suppose you replaced the Internet’s centralized Domain Name System with a blockchain for Internet names (like Namecoin) such that every DNS request included some proof-of-work effort. Or you used any blockchain (including Bitcoin’s) as a notary service. Or you built a new blockchain for crowdfunding. Or you replaced a centralized system which absolutely does need to be scrapped — that horrific barrel of worms known as TLS/SSL Certificate Authorities — with a blockchain-based solution powered at the browser level.Or you built a new distributed email service, with a blockchain for email addresses, and every time you checked your email you contributed to the network. Or a new distributed social network, with a blockchain verifying identities, powered by code that ran every time its users launched its app or visited its web page.(Technical note: this would obviously be a far more diffuse and granular system than Bitcoin’s, which runs on machines generally devoted 24/7 to mining. I don’t think that would require substantive changes to the algorithm, but while I’m a pretty good engineer I’m not an expert. That said, there’s no reason why a large number of relatively ephemeral clients would be fundamentally incompatible with a Hashcash-esque proof-of-work system, though I guess you might need a smaller subnet of persistent “supernodes” to maintain the blockchain.)To be clear, I’m not suggesting that some smart startup might turn around tomorrow and replace Gmail or Facebook with a blockchain-powered solution. But I am saying that some indeterminate number of years hence, as bandwidth improves, and processors grow ever more powerful, and storage gets ever cheaper, it’s not inconceivable that those massive server farms could be replaced, not with a “personal cloud” — a bad idea for many reasons — but by massive distributed peer-to-peer networks: open-source, encrypted end-to-end, and orchestrated in part by blockchains. I’m saying that I can at least envision, albeit vaguely, the decline of the Stacks. Which if you look at the Internet today seems like a pretty striking and revolutionary thing to say.For what it’s worth, I’m by no means alone in left field shouting that the blockchain is a big deal; heck, just look at Andreessen Horowitz over the last few months. And it seems likely that the blockchain, and Raft, and Spanner, and that great granddaddy of distributed peer-to-peer data called BitTorrent, are only the beginning; I expect more and more distributed-computing breakthroughs of comparable magnitude over the next decade, as the world’s searchlight minds turn to the forthcoming Internet Of Things.Last year I argued that “The Internet: we’re doing it wrong.” Now, though, only six months later, I see traces and hints that we’re finally making the first faltering motions towards doing it right. BitTorrent is thirteen years old, but it has only just now been done right (at least for pirates) in the form of Popcorn Time. Raft might be, in a sense, Paxos done right. Threadable looks like group communications done right (and, again, distributed, at least to the extent that email is distributed.) Keybase.io seems like a step towards PGP done right. TextSecure is cross-platform end-to-end-encrypted messaging done right.Maybe, just maybe, our online future is actually bright, and peer-to-peer, and encrypted end-to-end, and maybe even open-source and far less overtly commercial than today — and built, in part, on blockchains.(1)You can argue that it’s more a synthesis of previous theoretical breakthroughs than a completely new invention; whatever, I don’t care.', ""What's good enough for boutique PC builder iBuyPower is usually good enough for CyberPowerPC -- and vice versa. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that a few weeks after the iBuyPower CoinMine desktops , designed for Bitcoin mining, were released, CyberPower has responded with its new Mega Miner family of PCs, also for cryptocurrency mining.The Mega Miner lineup consists of three lines, which can be further customized from their base configurations. All feature AMD Radeon R9 graphics cards, which appear to be the coin mining card of choice. Starting at $989, the Mega Miner 100 comes with an AMD FX-4300 quad-core processor, 4GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, DVD burner, and a pair of Radeon R9 270X video cards. The next step up is the Mega Miner 200, which offers similar specs except it adds a trio of R9 280X cards instead -- and bumps the price to $1,929.For $2,569, the Mega Miner 300 switches to an Intel Core i3-4130 Haswell CPU, doubles the hard drive space, and features a trio of R9 290 graphics boards. It also deals with the heat from those powerful cards with a Corsair liquid-cooling solution -- the 100 and 200 models only include fan-based cooling, though various liquid-cooling kits are available as options. The systems come with Thermaltake DPS power supplies that monitor the electricity usage all of your mining is costing you.These new PCs, along with other projects like the Dopamine Bitcoin PC case , suggest the continued popularity of cryptocurrency mining, even as troubles like the recent Mt. Gox fiasco dog the nascent industry. Do you use your PC to mine cryptocurrency? Would you buy a new system like the Mega Miner to perform Bitcoin mining? Let us know in the Talkback section below."", 'Not all of bitcoin\'s proponents are radical libertarians -- venture capitalist Chris Dixon, for example, is both a cryptocurrency supporter and a self-described lifelong Democrat -- but many of them are.Last year, Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK) made news when it became the first major retailer to accept bitcoin. The announcement was hardly coincidental: The company\'s CEO, Patrick Byrne, is a noted libertarian who describes money as ""too important"" to leave in the hands of the government.To those who share Byrne\'s philosophy, the appeal of bitcoin comes from its resistance to inflation: Unlike U.S. dollars, whose supply is dictated by the Federal Reserve, the number of bitcoins is controlled mathematically. A hard cap is intrinsic to bitcoin\'s design, and though new bitcoins will continue to be mined into existence in the coming years, the total number of bitcoins will never exceed 21 million.Slaying LeviathanJeffrey Tucker, the CEO of Liberty.me, is one of those proponents. Characterizing bitcoin as the magic bullet that will slay ""Leviathan,"" he believes cryptocurrency is an unstoppable force, a technology that will end the age of big government.Tucker was once the editorial vice president of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, an economic think tank advocating the work of Ludwig von Mises, a somewhat obscure economist who supported unrestrained free markets. Mises was deeply opposed to central banking and advocated for a gold standard. To Tucker, and many bitcoin supporters, bitcoin is the gold standard of the digital age. Unable to be replicated, and not easily controlled by governments or central banks, bitcoin holds the promise of truly unregulated commerce.But Mark Spitznagel disagrees. The founder and CIO of Universa Investments (a hedge fund with around $6 billion in assets), Spitznagel is such a passionate believer in Mises\' theories that they form the basis of his investing strategy. In his recent book, The Dao of Capital, Spitznagel argues that investors can beat the market by successfully applying strategies derived from Mises\' work.Applying Mises\' theories, Spitznagel is expecting a major market correction -- he believes the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) could fall by as much as 40% in the coming months, as poor economic fundamentals finally catch up to the overvalued stock market.In the meantime, Spitznagel thinks investors should sit in U.S. Treasuries -- not bitcoin. Despite his own libertarian leanings, Spitznagel is deeply skeptical of Bitcoin, characterizing it as ""castle in the clouds."" Because bitcoin lacks intrinsic value of its own, Spitznagel told me, it\'s not wholly different from any existing fiat currency. It may help to facilitate digital commerce, but as it stands, it\'s simply an extension of the dollar.Just an extension of the U.S. dollarIndeed, while Overstock.com may accept bitcoin, it doesn\'t store them -- all the bitcoins Overstock.com takes in (now worth more than $1 million per day) are converted directly to U.S. dollars. The free publicity generated by bitcoin was unquestionably a smart move for Overstock, but Byrne is clearly intelligent enough not to saddle his company with extreme currency risk (and that\'s putting it mildly).The rising value of bitcoin has attracted a great deal of attention from investors -- Goldman Sachs released a report on bitcoin earlier this month, trashing it as a currency but suggesting its underlying technology could have some value. Warren Buffett wasn\'t as kind, telling investors to ""stay away,"" and arguing that its current valuation was ""a joke.""But with the cryptocurrency still trading near $600, bitcoin bulls remain undeterred. ""Treasury officials are clueless about bitcoin,"" Tucker told me. For someone whose ideology centers around distrusting the government, such an asset has obvious appeal. Still, there\'s no consensus, even among Fed critics: Spitznagel argues that all forms of money must have underlying ""commodity-value.""While there are people like Dixon out there, much of bitcoin\'s recent bid appears to be ideologically motivated. While the underlying technology could have some promise, I suspect those buying bitcoin out of opposition to the government are setting themselves up for failure.', 'Como los antiguos buscadores de oro del Oeste Americano, tu PC puede convertirse en un minero de monedas criptográficas.Las monedas electrónicas son en realidad complejos algoritmos que generan códigos encriptados. Dichas monedas no tienen un controlador. La mayoría de las criptomonedas disponen de una cadena de bloques que contabiliza todas las transacciones que se hacen. Esta cadena se mantiene mediante los ordenadores que están minando. La cadena genera un bloque (una moneda nueva) cuando todos los ordenadores conectados a ella lo aprueban por consenso. De esta manera se previenen abusos. Dicho bloque se lo quedan aquellos que estén minando en ese momento.EDITADO : Aunque la gama Mega Miner se anunció ayer como PCs para minar Bitcoins, sólo está indicada para minar criptomonedas basadas en Scrypt. Puedes encontrar una lista en Altcoin.com.La popularidad del Bitcoin ha hecho que sea imposible minarlo con ordenadores domésticos debido a su enorme red, y a la gran cantidad de hardware que se dedicaba a su minado, con equipos en parelelo que cuestan docenas de miles de euros, dedicados sólo a esta tarea. Por eso para minar desde casa se usan monedas basadas en el algoritmo Scrypt.Qué es Bitcoin y cómo se utilizaLa minería de criptomonedas basadas en Scrypt se lleva a cabo mediante fuerza fruta: un programa utiliza toda la potencia que le asignes de la CPU y la tarjeta gráfica que tengas, para calcular códigos, hasta encontrar alguno que sea aceptado por el protocolo de la moneda que estés minando.Lógicamente, como más potencia asignes más posibilidades de que obtengas tu recompensa.Minar monedas no es la panacea, y tienes que tener en cuenta el gasto de electricidad. Por eso existen mining pools, o grupos de minado: gente que mina en grupo, y si reciben una moneda, se la reparten entre todos, según la potencia asignada. Como más potencia tenga tu ordenador, más parte te llevas.La fiebre por minar monedas es tan alta, que ya existen tarjetas gráficas diseñadas sólo para esta tarea. E incluso PCs, como la gama Mega Miner de la marca CyberPowerPC.Los Mega Miner PC están optimizados para las labores de minería de criptomonedas. Incluyen las potentes tarjetas gráficas R9 de AMD, que pueden ejecutar hasta 1000 Khash/sg. Este valor hace referencia a la potencia de minado. Como más rápido sea, más posibilidades de conseguir monedas.Los Mega Miner de CyberPowerPC pueden integrar hasta tres tarjetas gráficas en paralelo, para triplicar la potencia. Además incluyen un software de monitorización que contabiliza el consumo en kilowatios, para que calcules si te resulta rentable seguir minando.El modelo Mega Miner 100 es el más económico. Cuesta 989 dólares y posee las siguientes especificaciones:Procesador AMD FX 43004 GB de memoria DDR32 tarjetas AMD R9 270x con 2 GB cada unaComo puedes ver, la memoria no es excesiva, porque para minar criptomonedas lo más importante es la CPU y la tarjeta gráfica.El modelo Mega Miner 300 dispone de tres placas gráficas AMD R9 290 con 4 GB de memoria RAM cada una, y se dispara hasta los 2569 dólares.', 'ShutterstockA political analyst and ecological network scientist have created a visual map of the Syrian conflict, the players involved and their various agendas. The creators hope the platform can, as more experts from across the Middle East contribute, help policy makers, analysts and diplomats find a solution. ""At the moment we\'re just trying to present a simplified and coherent visual narrative so the general reader can understand -- and keep coming back as it\'s refreshed -- to have an ongoing picture of what the conflict looks like and how it\'s developing,""AdvertisementScott Field, Middle East manager at the Skoll Global Threats Fund, told Wired.co.uk. ""The aspiration is it may develop into something that would help regional diplomats, people actually involved in the conflict itself, to have new insights and know how to solve some of the regional problems and conflicts themselves.""A PhD in behavioural ecology and visiting scholar at UC Berkeley\'s Institute of International Studies with an MA in political science, Field\'s knowledge of the conflict is vast. But he knows the massive complexities that go into its makeup, including the various political agendas brewing behind closed doors, are inaccessible to some and hard to keep track of for many.Read next Infoporn: the sharp decline in war deaths since 1946 Infoporn: the sharp decline in war deaths since 1946Field had spent years discussing with ecological network scientist Eric Berlow how complex systems could be analysed and visualised, and Berlow has since gone on to develop just such a technique through his organisation Vibrant Data, which has applied ecological approaches to the problem. Using its Mappr tool, Untangling Syria was born.The visualisation works by taking one player and their agenda as a point of reference, then mapping out from there. The US was chosen as that point of reference, so any nation that is aligned with the US on a particular topic is assigned a score of +2, any nation on side but which can be swayed to trade off for another interest is scored +1, and the reverse is assigned for those that disagree with a particular policy. Any nation neutral on the particular issue is assigned a score of zero.According to those scores, they are positioned closer or further away from the US. You can click on a country in one part of the diagram to see which countries are closer or further away from its ideals. This demonstrates things such as the fact the US has strong connections to many actors, but few connections to those actually involved in the conflict. Thus it\'s concluded it has strong interests, but limited ability to execute them.AdvertisementIn a different visualisation, the ties can be linked to specific polices. For instance, the demand for creating a Kurdish zone.Some of the links and answers might sound obvious to anyone that has delved into the politics. But those issues are constantly morphing and it is infinitely helpful to have an easily digestible overview.""You have a lot of great people with great expertise engaging and bringing forward analysis and ideas, but these tend to be fragmented,"" said Field. ""People analyse one part of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for instance. Whereas there\'s maybe 50 to 100 different issues involved with a conflict like this. What we were trying to do is move away from a fragmented and episodic analysis to a more systemic and cumulative one. If this platform can be developed to be a place where novel analysis and insights accumulate over time in one place to becomes a repository for insight I feel like that can be a great thing.""The analysis is all based on discussions based with ""high level players"" and experts in the region, off the record conversations with some of those players and published accounts. ""Certainly we\'ve realised the underlying data is not perfect, really this is an experiment,"" admits Field. ""This has never really been done before, and we\'re hoping to refine it on an ongoing basis.""AdvertisementWhen Wired.co.uk asks if there are concerns a player in Iran might build a map that looks very different, considering their perspective, Field said he hoped the team had been as objective as possible. ""That can definitely be improved, of course, by someone contributing who\'s a Tehran analyst sitting in Tehran and knows something I don\'t. This would be the ideal, to have a collaborative group pooling knowledge and expertise, so if I\'m trying to assess Saudi interests while in San Francisco, I don\'t get it completely wrong.""You can visit the maps here and here.Image: Christiaan Triebert / Shutterstock.com']","['Drop whatever you’re doing and go read Maciej Cegłowski’s absolutely magnificent essay Our Comrade The Electron, an astonishing history of the amazing Russian engineer Lev Sergeyevich Termen.

Consider, for instance, Google+ architect Yonatan Zunger’s explanation of “distributed consensus,” i.e. the means by which data can be safely preserved in distributed systems with multiple editors. It’s absolutely brilliant — but none of its 8,000 words are wasted. The gold-standard “Paxos” algorithm is sufficiently complex that a pair of Stanford engineers recently published a paper entitled “In Search Of An Understandable Consensus Algorithm” (PDF) — the title of which sums up the state of the art nicely — in which they present a new alternative, “Raft.”Distributed algorithms, distributed data, distributed systems, distributed security: messy, tricky, complicated, a maze of vibrating tightropes stretched across an N-dimensional pit full of hungry failure modes with sharp teeth. Hard stuff.But not impossible.Just ask Satoshi Nakamoto.Beyond the hype and the greed, Bitcoin is powered by a genuine technical breakthrough(1), to a degree I did not properly appreciate when I first started writing about it. The “blockchain” — the engine on which Bitcoin is built — is a new kind of distributed consensus system that allows transactions, or other data, to be securely stored and verified without any centralized authority at all, because (to grossly oversimplify) they are validated by the entire network. Those transactions don’t have to be financial; that data doesn’t have to be money. The engine that powers Bitcoin can be used for a whole array of other applications…Currently at 89 categories of things that can be placed on blockchain. Not bad BTC-Twitter for 3 hours work. :) http://t.co/jf56nPNDqM — Antonis Polemitis (@polemitis) March 12, 2014…with one huge caveat. As Michael Nielsen puts it, in his excellent, detailed explanation of how Bitcoin actually works:For [the blockchain] to have any chance of succeeding, network users need an incentive to help validate transactions. Without such an incentive, they have no reason to expend valuable computational power, merely to help validate other people’s transactions. And if network users are not willing to expend that power, then the whole system won’t work. The solution to this problem is to reward people who help validate transactions.Satoshi Nakamoto’s genius was twofold; technically, he built the world’s first(1) blockchain; socially, he lured people into powering it, using good old filthy lucre as an incentive. Which was very effective, but is now also a little awkward, as Bitcoin-as-a-currency has attracted a large number of … er … let’s diplomatically call them “colorful personalities,” and also, money-as-a-store-of-value is one field where in fact you probably do want some centralized authority, or at least insurance. I agree with the mordant observations on Twitter that it’s highly amusing watching the extremist fringes of the Bitcoin community slowly rediscover from first principles exactly why financial regulation exists in the first place.Meanwhile, though, the noise and smoke of the ongoing endless (and endlessly entertaining) Bitcoin sturm und drang has — ironically — obscured its real breakthrough; the blockchain.You see, it’s not that hard to imagine other blockchain-based systems which aren’t currencies and don’t attract as many “colorful personalities.” Suppose you replaced the Internet’s centralized Domain Name System with a blockchain for Internet names (like Namecoin) such that every DNS request included some proof-of-work effort. Or you used any blockchain (including Bitcoin’s) as a notary service. Or you built a new blockchain for crowdfunding. Or you replaced a centralized system which absolutely does need to be scrapped — that horrific barrel of worms known as TLS/SSL Certificate Authorities — with a blockchain-based solution powered at the browser level.Or you built a new distributed email service, with a blockchain for email addresses, and every time you checked your email you contributed to the network. Or a new distributed social network, with a blockchain verifying identities, powered by code that ran every time its users launched its app or visited its web page.(Technical note: this would obviously be a far more diffuse and granular system than Bitcoin’s, which runs on machines generally devoted 24/7 to mining. I don’t think that would require substantive changes to the algorithm, but while I’m a pretty good engineer I’m not an expert. That said, there’s no reason why a large number of relatively ephemeral clients would be fundamentally incompatible with a Hashcash-esque proof-of-work system, though I guess you might need a smaller subnet of persistent “supernodes” to maintain the blockchain.)To be clear, I’m not suggesting that some smart startup might turn around tomorrow and replace Gmail or Facebook with a blockchain-powered solution. But I am saying that some indeterminate number of years hence, as bandwidth improves, and processors grow ever more powerful, and storage gets ever cheaper, it’s not inconceivable that those massive server farms could be replaced, not with a “personal cloud” — a bad idea for many reasons — but by massive distributed peer-to-peer networks: open-source, encrypted end-to-end, and orchestrated in part by blockchains. I’m saying that I can at least envision, albeit vaguely, the decline of the Stacks. Which if you look at the Internet today seems like a pretty striking and revolutionary thing to say.For what it’s worth, I’m by no means alone in left field shouting that the blockchain is a big deal; heck, just look at Andreessen Horowitz over the last few months. And it seems likely that the blockchain, and Raft, and Spanner, and that great granddaddy of distributed peer-to-peer data called BitTorrent, are only the beginning; I expect more and more distributed-computing breakthroughs of comparable magnitude over the next decade, as the world’s searchlight minds turn to the forthcoming Internet Of Things.Last year I argued that “The Internet: we’re doing it wrong.” Now, though, only six months later, I see traces and hints that we’re finally making the first faltering motions towards doing it right. BitTorrent is thirteen years old, but it has only just now been done right (at least for pirates) in the form of Popcorn Time. Raft might be, in a sense, Paxos done right. Threadable looks like group communications done right (and, again, distributed, at least to the extent that email is distributed.) Keybase.io seems like a step towards PGP done right. TextSecure is cross-platform end-to-end-encrypted messaging done right.Maybe, just maybe, our online future is actually bright, and peer-to-peer, and encrypted end-to-end, and maybe even open-source and far less overtly commercial than today — and built, in part, on blockchains.(1)You can argue that it’s more a synthesis of previous theoretical breakthroughs than a completely new invention; whatever, I don’t care.', ""What's good enough for boutique PC builder iBuyPower is usually good enough for CyberPowerPC -- and vice versa. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that a few weeks after the iBuyPower CoinMine desktops , designed for Bitcoin mining, were released, CyberPower has responded with its new Mega Miner family of PCs, also for cryptocurrency mining.The Mega Miner lineup consists of three lines, which can be further customized from their base configurations. All feature AMD Radeon R9 graphics cards, which appear to be the coin mining card of choice. Starting at $989, the Mega Miner 100 comes with an AMD FX-4300 quad-core processor, 4GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, DVD burner, and a pair of Radeon R9 270X video cards. The next step up is the Mega Miner 200, which offers similar specs except it adds a trio of R9 280X cards instead -- and bumps the price to $1,929.For $2,569, the Mega Miner 300 switches to an Intel Core i3-4130 Haswell CPU, doubles the hard drive space, and features a trio of R9 290 graphics boards. It also deals with the heat from those powerful cards with a Corsair liquid-cooling solution -- the 100 and 200 models only include fan-based cooling, though various liquid-cooling kits are available as options. The systems come with Thermaltake DPS power supplies that monitor the electricity usage all of your mining is costing you.These new PCs, along with other projects like the Dopamine Bitcoin PC case , suggest the continued popularity of cryptocurrency mining, even as troubles like the recent Mt. Gox fiasco dog the nascent industry. Do you use your PC to mine cryptocurrency? Would you buy a new system like the Mega Miner to perform Bitcoin mining? Let us know in the Talkback section below."", 'Not all of bitcoin\'s proponents are radical libertarians -- venture capitalist Chris Dixon, for example, is both a cryptocurrency supporter and a self-described lifelong Democrat -- but many of them are.Last year, Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK) made news when it became the first major retailer to accept bitcoin. The announcement was hardly coincidental: The company\'s CEO, Patrick Byrne, is a noted libertarian who describes money as ""too important"" to leave in the hands of the government.To those who share Byrne\'s philosophy, the appeal of bitcoin comes from its resistance to inflation: Unlike U.S. dollars, whose supply is dictated by the Federal Reserve, the number of bitcoins is controlled mathematically. A hard cap is intrinsic to bitcoin\'s design, and though new bitcoins will continue to be mined into existence in the coming years, the total number of bitcoins will never exceed 21 million.Slaying LeviathanJeffrey Tucker, the CEO of Liberty.me, is one of those proponents. Characterizing bitcoin as the magic bullet that will slay ""Leviathan,"" he believes cryptocurrency is an unstoppable force, a technology that will end the age of big government.Tucker was once the editorial vice president of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, an economic think tank advocating the work of Ludwig von Mises, a somewhat obscure economist who supported unrestrained free markets. Mises was deeply opposed to central banking and advocated for a gold standard. To Tucker, and many bitcoin supporters, bitcoin is the gold standard of the digital age. Unable to be replicated, and not easily controlled by governments or central banks, bitcoin holds the promise of truly unregulated commerce.But Mark Spitznagel disagrees. The founder and CIO of Universa Investments (a hedge fund with around $6 billion in assets), Spitznagel is such a passionate believer in Mises\' theories that they form the basis of his investing strategy. In his recent book, The Dao of Capital, Spitznagel argues that investors can beat the market by successfully applying strategies derived from Mises\' work.Applying Mises\' theories, Spitznagel is expecting a major market correction -- he believes the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) could fall by as much as 40% in the coming months, as poor economic fundamentals finally catch up to the overvalued stock market.In the meantime, Spitznagel thinks investors should sit in U.S. Treasuries -- not bitcoin. Despite his own libertarian leanings, Spitznagel is deeply skeptical of Bitcoin, characterizing it as ""castle in the clouds."" Because bitcoin lacks intrinsic value of its own, Spitznagel told me, it\'s not wholly different from any existing fiat currency. It may help to facilitate digital commerce, but as it stands, it\'s simply an extension of the dollar.Just an extension of the U.S. dollarIndeed, while Overstock.com may accept bitcoin, it doesn\'t store them -- all the bitcoins Overstock.com takes in (now worth more than $1 million per day) are converted directly to U.S. dollars. The free publicity generated by bitcoin was unquestionably a smart move for Overstock, but Byrne is clearly intelligent enough not to saddle his company with extreme currency risk (and that\'s putting it mildly).The rising value of bitcoin has attracted a great deal of attention from investors -- Goldman Sachs released a report on bitcoin earlier this month, trashing it as a currency but suggesting its underlying technology could have some value. Warren Buffett wasn\'t as kind, telling investors to ""stay away,"" and arguing that its current valuation was ""a joke.""But with the cryptocurrency still trading near $600, bitcoin bulls remain undeterred. ""Treasury officials are clueless about bitcoin,"" Tucker told me. For someone whose ideology centers around distrusting the government, such an asset has obvious appeal. Still, there\'s no consensus, even among Fed critics: Spitznagel argues that all forms of money must have underlying ""commodity-value.""While there are people like Dixon out there, much of bitcoin\'s recent bid appears to be ideologically motivated. While the underlying technology could have some promise, I suspect those buying bitcoin out of opposition to the government are setting themselves up for failure.', 'Como los antiguos buscadores de oro del Oeste Americano, tu PC puede convertirse en un minero de monedas criptográficas.Las monedas electrónicas son en realidad complejos algoritmos que generan códigos encriptados. Dichas monedas no tienen un controlador. La mayoría de las criptomonedas disponen de una cadena de bloques que contabiliza todas las transacciones que se hacen. Esta cadena se mantiene mediante los ordenadores que están minando. La cadena genera un bloque (una moneda nueva) cuando todos los ordenadores conectados a ella lo aprueban por consenso. De esta manera se previenen abusos. Dicho bloque se lo quedan aquellos que estén minando en ese momento.EDITADO : Aunque la gama Mega Miner se anunció ayer como PCs para minar Bitcoins, sólo está indicada para minar criptomonedas basadas en Scrypt. Puedes encontrar una lista en Altcoin.com.La popularidad del Bitcoin ha hecho que sea imposible minarlo con ordenadores domésticos debido a su enorme red, y a la gran cantidad de hardware que se dedicaba a su minado, con equipos en parelelo que cuestan docenas de miles de euros, dedicados sólo a esta tarea. Por eso para minar desde casa se usan monedas basadas en el algoritmo Scrypt.Qué es Bitcoin y cómo se utilizaLa minería de criptomonedas basadas en Scrypt se lleva a cabo mediante fuerza fruta: un programa utiliza toda la potencia que le asignes de la CPU y la tarjeta gráfica que tengas, para calcular códigos, hasta encontrar alguno que sea aceptado por el protocolo de la moneda que estés minando.Lógicamente, como más potencia asignes más posibilidades de que obtengas tu recompensa.Minar monedas no es la panacea, y tienes que tener en cuenta el gasto de electricidad. Por eso existen mining pools, o grupos de minado: gente que mina en grupo, y si reciben una moneda, se la reparten entre todos, según la potencia asignada. Como más potencia tenga tu ordenador, más parte te llevas.La fiebre por minar monedas es tan alta, que ya existen tarjetas gráficas diseñadas sólo para esta tarea. E incluso PCs, como la gama Mega Miner de la marca CyberPowerPC.Los Mega Miner PC están optimizados para las labores de minería de criptomonedas. Incluyen las potentes tarjetas gráficas R9 de AMD, que pueden ejecutar hasta 1000 Khash/sg. Este valor hace referencia a la potencia de minado. Como más rápido sea, más posibilidades de conseguir monedas.Los Mega Miner de CyberPowerPC pueden integrar hasta tres tarjetas gráficas en paralelo, para triplicar la potencia. Además incluyen un software de monitorización que contabiliza el consumo en kilowatios, para que calcules si te resulta rentable seguir minando.El modelo Mega Miner 100 es el más económico. Cuesta 989 dólares y posee las siguientes especificaciones:Procesador AMD FX 43004 GB de memoria DDR32 tarjetas AMD R9 270x con 2 GB cada unaComo puedes ver, la memoria no es excesiva, porque para minar criptomonedas lo más importante es la CPU y la tarjeta gráfica.El modelo Mega Miner 300 dispone de tres placas gráficas AMD R9 290 con 4 GB de memoria RAM cada una, y se dispara hasta los 2569 dólares.', 'ShutterstockA political analyst and ecological network scientist have created a visual map of the Syrian conflict, the players involved and their various agendas. The creators hope the platform can, as more experts from across the Middle East contribute, help policy makers, analysts and diplomats find a solution. ""At the moment we\'re just trying to present a simplified and coherent visual narrative so the general reader can understand -- and keep coming back as it\'s refreshed -- to have an ongoing picture of what the conflict looks like and how it\'s developing,""AdvertisementScott Field, Middle East manager at the Skoll Global Threats Fund, told Wired.co.uk. ""The aspiration is it may develop into something that would help regional diplomats, people actually involved in the conflict itself, to have new insights and know how to solve some of the regional problems and conflicts themselves.""A PhD in behavioural ecology and visiting scholar at UC Berkeley\'s Institute of International Studies with an MA in political science, Field\'s knowledge of the conflict is vast. But he knows the massive complexities that go into its makeup, including the various political agendas brewing behind closed doors, are inaccessible to some and hard to keep track of for many.Read next Infoporn: the sharp decline in war deaths since 1946 Infoporn: the sharp decline in war deaths since 1946Field had spent years discussing with ecological network scientist Eric Berlow how complex systems could be analysed and visualised, and Berlow has since gone on to develop just such a technique through his organisation Vibrant Data, which has applied ecological approaches to the problem. Using its Mappr tool, Untangling Syria was born.The visualisation works by taking one player and their agenda as a point of reference, then mapping out from there. The US was chosen as that point of reference, so any nation that is aligned with the US on a particular topic is assigned a score of +2, any nation on side but which can be swayed to trade off for another interest is scored +1, and the reverse is assigned for those that disagree with a particular policy. Any nation neutral on the particular issue is assigned a score of zero.According to those scores, they are positioned closer or further away from the US. You can click on a country in one part of the diagram to see which countries are closer or further away from its ideals. This demonstrates things such as the fact the US has strong connections to many actors, but few connections to those actually involved in the conflict. Thus it\'s concluded it has strong interests, but limited ability to execute them.AdvertisementIn a different visualisation, the ties can be linked to specific polices. For instance, the demand for creating a Kurdish zone.Some of the links and answers might sound obvious to anyone that has delved into the politics. But those issues are constantly morphing and it is infinitely helpful to have an easily digestible overview.""You have a lot of great people with great expertise engaging and bringing forward analysis and ideas, but these tend to be fragmented,"" said Field. ""People analyse one part of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for instance. Whereas there\'s maybe 50 to 100 different issues involved with a conflict like this. What we were trying to do is move away from a fragmented and episodic analysis to a more systemic and cumulative one. If this platform can be developed to be a place where novel analysis and insights accumulate over time in one place to becomes a repository for insight I feel like that can be a great thing.""The analysis is all based on discussions based with ""high level players"" and experts in the region, off the record conversations with some of those players and published accounts. ""Certainly we\'ve realised the underlying data is not perfect, really this is an experiment,"" admits Field. ""This has never really been done before, and we\'re hoping to refine it on an ongoing basis.""AdvertisementWhen Wired.co.uk asks if there are concerns a player in Iran might build a map that looks very different, considering their perspective, Field said he hoped the team had been as objective as possible. ""That can definitely be improved, of course, by someone contributing who\'s a Tehran analyst sitting in Tehran and knows something I don\'t. This would be the ideal, to have a collaborative group pooling knowledge and expertise, so if I\'m trying to assess Saudi interests while in San Francisco, I don\'t get it completely wrong.""You can visit the maps here and here.Image: Christiaan Triebert / Shutterstock.com']"

And proceeded to suggest the negative opinion on Bitcoin from Buffett and others like him was unwarranted.Although he said he was happy to meet with Buffett and further discuss the topic, he also provided the reason for his somewhat disparaging remarks about Buffett by saying, ""when people who don\'t understand tech attack new tech, it\'s fair game to call them on it. People should know what they\'re talking about.""The themeBuffett once remarked a key to investing was to ""never invest in a business you can\'t understand,"" so it\'s easy to believe his own opinion on Bitcoin was one of sheer misunderstanding. This could help explain why Andreessen so distinctly disdained Buffett\'s comments.But a further glance at Buffett\'s actual stance on Bitcoin reveals he knows exactly what it is and its value:It\'s a method of transmitting money. It\'s a very effective way of transmitting money and you can do it anonymously and all that. A check is a way of transmitting money, too. Are checks worth a whole lot of money just because they can transmit money? ... I hope Bitcoin becomes a better way of doing it, but you can replicate it a bunch of different ways and it will be.

These advantages became clear to me during a recent trip to South America.Below are some of the problems that international travellers currently deal with.Hassle of currency conversionWhen travelling to foreign countries, it can be a major hassle to convert to local currencies and carry around local cash. I traveled to Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, on my trip and had to worry about exchanging currency three times (when both entering and leaving a new country).Wouldn't it be great to be able to eliminate one of the major hassles of international trips? As a global currency used by consumers and merchants worldwide, bitcoin eliminates the need for dealing with multiple currency conversions and carrying a lot of cash.High feesIn addition to the hassle of dealing with currency conversion and carrying cash, it can also be quite costly to get cash and make payments in new countries. During my time in Brazil, I incurred three approximately $15 ATM fees to withdraw Brazilian Reals from a local bank – a $10 charge from my large US-based bank, in addition to $5 from the local Brazilian bank – for each withdrawal. I incurred one $15 ATM fee in Buenos Aires, as well. Additionally, I was charged a fee every time I used my card to make a purchase.The twelve times I swiped my card to buy something ended up costing me $36 dollars. The high fees I paid ($96 in total) on my trip highlight the massive friction that exists between existing payment networks worldwide.An open, global payment network reduces friction and fees. As the world continues to become more inter-connected, I think this will become a more obvious benefit of bitcoin.Payment fraudWhen you use your credit card internationally, you give unfamiliar foreign merchants your payment credentials. These merchants can either intentionally or unintentionally expose those payment credentials to criminals.While I was in Buenos Aires, I purchased water at a convenience store. The following day, I got a call from my bank telling me I had hundreds of dollars of fraudulent charges made with my debit card.The unfamiliar merchant in Buenos Aires must have exposed my payment credentials to a fraudster. My bank account was compromised, and while the charges were covered, my bank told me it would take five to seven business days for them to mail me a new debit card. This left me without access to my bank account for a week in a foreign country.Luckily, I had another card to cover me from the rest of the trip, but I’m not sure what I would have done if I did not. This is a scenario I suspect is all too familiar for many who have travelled internationally.The solutionBitcoin solves many problems that international travellers currently deal with. It eliminates the hassle and fees associated with converting to local currencies and carrying cash, and it securely protects the payment credentials of consumers to avoid fraud risk and the potential to lose bank account access in a foreign country.While it is tough to travel with only bitcoin on international trips at the moment, the rapid merchant adoption of bitcoin is changing this.Travel-focused merchants such as CheapAir.com, BTCTrip and Pointshound are just a few merchants generating significant bitcoin sales from international travellers. As more travel related merchants accept bitcoin, and consumers continue to realize the huge efficiencies that bitcoin provides, I expect the travel space to continue to lead bitcoin adoption.Next time I travel internationally, I hope to be able to leave my credit and debit cards at home.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Even if all these attacks were targeted against MtGox, MtGox needs to explain the whereabouts of 849,600 bitcoin.” - University of ZurichMtGox latest revelations follows an analysis of the block chain by researchers at the University of Zurich that failed to identify such mass theft of bitcoins by means of transaction malleability where the estimate is put at less than 500 rather than the 800,000 suggested by MtGox and therefore as I have alluded to several times since the MtGox debacle began that most of the 'lost' bitcoins or their fiat currency conversion remain with those behind MtGox rather than to have been stolen by outside hackers.25 Feb 2014 - Bitcoin Ponzi Scam Crash Update - MTGox Vanishing Act, Who Will be Next ?'Magic the Gathering' has been busy throwing up a smoke screen for several weeks as to what has actually happened to its customers 750,000 bitcoins with statements such as that the exchange had been subject to hacking, cracking and theft the truth of which can only be ascertained via a police investigation that will look at the evidence, if they can find any left as the MTGox has shut its offices and melted away, busily deleting any evidence that it actually ever existed as evidenced by its Twitter account having been wiped blank.Now it is upto the authorities to determine whether an estimated $375 million fraud has taken place or not, that apparently sought to hook investors to deposit their funds into the fictional currency and then to vanish in a puff of smoke, leaving investors literally crying outside its former offices with stories of how their bitcoin holdings running into the hundreds of thousands of dollars have just vanished.In fact if one follows the logical conclusion then MtGox being exposed to 'transaction malleability' may not have been by chance but rather by design i.e. to hide a crime within a crime so as to create enough smoke and mirrors to disappear with the bulk of bitcoin holdings.If MtGox representatives under pressure of criminal investigation by the Japanese police can apparently just happen to find 200,000 bitcoins behind an electronic sofa then how many more hundreds of thousands of bitcoins would they find following further pressure for instance form the FBI?If as little as 500 is actually estimated to have been stolen by outsiders then this suggests that the current outstanding balance of some 600,000 remains with the insiders. So watch this space for many more hundreds of thousands of bitcoins to be conveniently found in old electronic socks, shoes, coat pockets, drawers etc over the coming months. Though don't ever expect to see all of the missing bitcoin balance materialise because I suspect much (many $ millions) of it has been spent living the high life at bitcoin customers expense!Proponents of the bitcoin scam continue to point to a relatively stable price whilst convientely forgetting what actually tends to happen in terms of price for holders of bitcoins parked at the multitude of exchanges (web sites) such as MtGox as they disappear in a puff of smoke taking the worthless price based valuations with them.As I explained in my last bitcoin article that the bitcoin scam is meant to operate in such a manner of presenting a calm stable price to allow the pump and dump storm to take place that seeks to hard earned fiat currency from the crypto-currency noobs.02 Mar 2014 - Bitcoin the Perfect Scam, Price Does Not Reflect True Dangers of Holding Bitcoins -Bitcoin Exchanges are a Ponzi ScamThe bitcoin exchanges have been busy distancing themselves from MTGox as if they are something different, more trustworthy, when the truth is they are the SAME - NO DIFFERENT!In fact you are all being duped for they are not really exchanges at all! They are NOT akin to the stock exchange or commodities exchange but just websites that some techies set up that may have started out honest but greed will get the better of them just as it did with MTGox because as MTGox illustrated the prices being quoted are meaningless, there is no volume!Unregulated Bitcoin exchanges are the natural consequence of the crypto currency scams for their primary purpose is to entice new entrants to buy bitcoins that the exchanges say they hold. How do they achieve this ? They do it by producing fancy trading graphs that show the price of bitcoins as rising and being high which encourages the fools to send the exchanges their hard earned money that they will never see again!This is what the exchanges do, they get fools to send them money for bitcoins that allegedly NEVER existed, this is why when MTGox went bust it stated that some 800,000 bitcoins disappeared when the truth is that they probably never existed!It is as I warned several months ago a PONZI SCAM! The exchanges pay out those selling / transferring their bitcoins out with money from new investors as long as new investors are greater than those exiting the ponzi scam continues.The bitcoin exchanges make it very easy to BUY bitcoins with them but make it near impossible to withdraw, transfer out, as their primary purpose is to suck as many investors into their vortex as possible. So watch this space for whether or not the authorities in Japan charge MTGox with being a Ponzi Scam.The Anatomy of CraptoCurrency ScamsTake this as a concise guide as to how crypto-currency scams tend to work.1. New crapto-coins craptocurrency is developed allowing the creator and his friends to easily mine approx 1/3rd of the total potential supply before going public.2. Holders of crapto-coins agree to withhold their supply from the market before it goes public.3. Start to promote the craptocurrency by handing out free crapto-coins to the media, with likes of Max Keiser at the top of the list to start pumping.4. Crapto-coins start trading and immediately jump in price due to limited supply.5. Illiquid crapto-coins have a high market capitalisation due to a high price and number of coins (not) in circulation which encourages more media exposure and interest.6. Many fools jump on the bandwagon buying expensive hardware to mine crapto-coins given the high price per crapto-coins (over 90% of mined supply with-held from market).7. Many websites appear that add the tag exchanges to them to give the air of authority that suck in entrants by producing graphs and data that gives the illusion of rising prices and volume of trading when in reality they are nothing more than Ponzi scams as they limit withdrawals.8. As interest and prices continue to rise, the creator and his friends slowly offload supply onto the fools until the price crashes and the noobs have been bled dry or holdings vaporise MTGox style.9. The crapto-coins hoarders wait for the dust to settle and noobs to be encouraged once more into buying as the price is stable and then repeat the dump and crash several times more.That's how Bitcoin and ALL craptocurrency scams workSource and Comments: http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article45012.htmlNadeem Walayathttp://www.marketoracle.co.ukCopyright © 2005-2014 Marketoracle.co.uk (Market Oracle Ltd).

On Wednesday, the island’s Financial Supervision Commission(FSC) affirmed that “a Bitcoin exchange that holds client funds with a licensed overseas payment service provider is not required to obtain a license in the country for its activities,” according to Coindesk. However, this act of lenience might not last forever.The FSC says that their ruling might change in order to regulate the digital currencies. Thus, it’s important for people who wish to use digital currencies to keep track of any new legislation and be prepared for possible changes.Operators Considering Isle of Man Want RegulationBarrister and solicitor, R Paul Davis, is the Group General Counsel for the Counting House Services companies. He has written a guest article in Coindesk about the Isle of Man becoming a harbor for Bitcoin.Davis writes that working within the rules of the FSC might be daunting to some, however many exchange operators who are looking forward to working in the Isle of Man would like regulation.“This would open the doors of at least two specialized island banks who are ready to offer facilities to regulated entities, but not to unlicensed businesses.”Before any legislation is done, however, Davis believes that the FSC will need some time to better understand the new field of virtual currencies.Why Isle of Man is good for Bitcoin?Due to the fact that business pay no corporate taxes and banks only 10% on the Isle of Man, having Bitcoin exchanges and business will be a good move. In addition to the low tax rates, the island, according to Davis, has a“Massive bandwith and redundancy, with world-class DDoS protection and multiple options for secure hosting.”This will definitely be important for Bitcoin, seeing as how ex-Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox met its demise due to a supposed DDoS attack.Furthermore, the island is known as a safe haven for financial institutions and businesses. After the FSC decision, Davis writes that two Bitcoin exchanges have started their business on the island. In fact, up to 15 more exchanges are considering making the island a base for their operations, according to Eric Benz of the UK Digital Currency Association.Davis writes that on April 1st, 30 people from the Isle of Man who are interested in Bitcoin will meet to create the Manx Digital Currency Association. This means that some people in the island are getting interested in Bitcoin.At the end of the day, the Isle of Man seems like a good place to commence Bitcoin operations as the island appears to be a fantastic financial hub.For more Bitcoin news, subscribe to CoinReport.Image Source']","['The questions surrounding the true value of Bitcoin swirled even more this week as an Internet and technology pioneer didn\'t take kindly to Warren Buffett\'s recent remarks surrounding the crypto-currency.The storyIt\'s been widely reported Warren Buffett, with a net worth of nearly $64 billion, suggested the popular crypto-currency bitcoin was a ""mirage,"" during an interview with CNBC earlier this month.At a conference Marc Andreessen, who co-founded Netscape, an ardent Bitcoin enthusiast -- and investor -- didn\'t appreciate the comment and suggested Buffett overstepped his expertise by commenting on the technology.

Even if all these attacks were targeted against MtGox, MtGox needs to explain the whereabouts of 849,600 bitcoin.” - University of ZurichMtGox latest revelations follows an analysis of the block chain by researchers at the University of Zurich that failed to identify such mass theft of bitcoins by means of transaction malleability where the estimate is put at less than 500 rather than the 800,000 suggested by MtGox and therefore as I have alluded to several times since the MtGox debacle began that most of the 'lost' bitcoins or their fiat currency conversion remain with those behind MtGox rather than to have been stolen by outside hackers.25 Feb 2014 - Bitcoin Ponzi Scam Crash Update - MTGox Vanishing Act, Who Will be Next ?'Magic the Gathering' has been busy throwing up a smoke screen for several weeks as to what has actually happened to its customers 750,000 bitcoins with statements such as that the exchange had been subject to hacking, cracking and theft the truth of which can only be ascertained via a police investigation that will look at the evidence, if they can find any left as the MTGox has shut its offices and melted away, busily deleting any evidence that it actually ever existed as evidenced by its Twitter account having been wiped blank.Now it is upto the authorities to determine whether an estimated $375 million fraud has taken place or not, that apparently sought to hook investors to deposit their funds into the fictional currency and then to vanish in a puff of smoke, leaving investors literally crying outside its former offices with stories of how their bitcoin holdings running into the hundreds of thousands of dollars have just vanished.In fact if one follows the logical conclusion then MtGox being exposed to 'transaction malleability' may not have been by chance but rather by design i.e. to hide a crime within a crime so as to create enough smoke and mirrors to disappear with the bulk of bitcoin holdings.If MtGox representatives under pressure of criminal investigation by the Japanese police can apparently just happen to find 200,000 bitcoins behind an electronic sofa then how many more hundreds of thousands of bitcoins would they find following further pressure for instance form the FBI?If as little as 500 is actually estimated to have been stolen by outsiders then this suggests that the current outstanding balance of some 600,000 remains with the insiders. So watch this space for many more hundreds of thousands of bitcoins to be conveniently found in old electronic socks, shoes, coat pockets, drawers etc over the coming months. Though don't ever expect to see all of the missing bitcoin balance materialise because I suspect much (many $ millions) of it has been spent living the high life at bitcoin customers expense!Proponents of the bitcoin scam continue to point to a relatively stable price whilst convientely forgetting what actually tends to happen in terms of price for holders of bitcoins parked at the multitude of exchanges (web sites) such as MtGox as they disappear in a puff of smoke taking the worthless price based valuations with them.As I explained in my last bitcoin article that the bitcoin scam is meant to operate in such a manner of presenting a calm stable price to allow the pump and dump storm to take place that seeks to hard earned fiat currency from the crypto-currency noobs.02 Mar 2014 - Bitcoin the Perfect Scam, Price Does Not Reflect True Dangers of Holding Bitcoins -Bitcoin Exchanges are a Ponzi ScamThe bitcoin exchanges have been busy distancing themselves from MTGox as if they are something different, more trustworthy, when the truth is they are the SAME - NO DIFFERENT!In fact you are all being duped for they are not really exchanges at all! They are NOT akin to the stock exchange or commodities exchange but just websites that some techies set up that may have started out honest but greed will get the better of them just as it did with MTGox because as MTGox illustrated the prices being quoted are meaningless, there is no volume!Unregulated Bitcoin exchanges are the natural consequence of the crypto currency scams for their primary purpose is to entice new entrants to buy bitcoins that the exchanges say they hold. How do they achieve this ? They do it by producing fancy trading graphs that show the price of bitcoins as rising and being high which encourages the fools to send the exchanges their hard earned money that they will never see again!This is what the exchanges do, they get fools to send them money for bitcoins that allegedly NEVER existed, this is why when MTGox went bust it stated that some 800,000 bitcoins disappeared when the truth is that they probably never existed!It is as I warned several months ago a PONZI SCAM! The exchanges pay out those selling / transferring their bitcoins out with money from new investors as long as new investors are greater than those exiting the ponzi scam continues.The bitcoin exchanges make it very easy to BUY bitcoins with them but make it near impossible to withdraw, transfer out, as their primary purpose is to suck as many investors into their vortex as possible. So watch this space for whether or not the authorities in Japan charge MTGox with being a Ponzi Scam.The Anatomy of CraptoCurrency ScamsTake this as a concise guide as to how crypto-currency scams tend to work.1. New crapto-coins craptocurrency is developed allowing the creator and his friends to easily mine approx 1/3rd of the total potential supply before going public.2. Holders of crapto-coins agree to withhold their supply from the market before it goes public.3. Start to promote the craptocurrency by handing out free crapto-coins to the media, with likes of Max Keiser at the top of the list to start pumping.4. Crapto-coins start trading and immediately jump in price due to limited supply.5. Illiquid crapto-coins have a high market capitalisation due to a high price and number of coins (not) in circulation which encourages more media exposure and interest.6. Many fools jump on the bandwagon buying expensive hardware to mine crapto-coins given the high price per crapto-coins (over 90% of mined supply with-held from market).7. Many websites appear that add the tag exchanges to them to give the air of authority that suck in entrants by producing graphs and data that gives the illusion of rising prices and volume of trading when in reality they are nothing more than Ponzi scams as they limit withdrawals.8. As interest and prices continue to rise, the creator and his friends slowly offload supply onto the fools until the price crashes and the noobs have been bled dry or holdings vaporise MTGox style.9. The crapto-coins hoarders wait for the dust to settle and noobs to be encouraged once more into buying as the price is stable and then repeat the dump and crash several times more.That's how Bitcoin and ALL craptocurrency scams workSource and Comments: http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article45012.htmlNadeem Walayathttp://www.marketoracle.co.ukCopyright © 2005-2014 Marketoracle.co.uk (Market Oracle Ltd).

On Wednesday, the island’s Financial Supervision Commission(FSC) affirmed that “a Bitcoin exchange that holds client funds with a licensed overseas payment service provider is not required to obtain a license in the country for its activities,” according to Coindesk. However, this act of lenience might not last forever.The FSC says that their ruling might change in order to regulate the digital currencies. Thus, it’s important for people who wish to use digital currencies to keep track of any new legislation and be prepared for possible changes.Operators Considering Isle of Man Want RegulationBarrister and solicitor, R Paul Davis, is the Group General Counsel for the Counting House Services companies. He has written a guest article in Coindesk about the Isle of Man becoming a harbor for Bitcoin.Davis writes that working within the rules of the FSC might be daunting to some, however many exchange operators who are looking forward to working in the Isle of Man would like regulation.“This would open the doors of at least two specialized island banks who are ready to offer facilities to regulated entities, but not to unlicensed businesses.”Before any legislation is done, however, Davis believes that the FSC will need some time to better understand the new field of virtual currencies.Why Isle of Man is good for Bitcoin?Due to the fact that business pay no corporate taxes and banks only 10% on the Isle of Man, having Bitcoin exchanges and business will be a good move. In addition to the low tax rates, the island, according to Davis, has a“Massive bandwith and redundancy, with world-class DDoS protection and multiple options for secure hosting.”This will definitely be important for Bitcoin, seeing as how ex-Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox met its demise due to a supposed DDoS attack.Furthermore, the island is known as a safe haven for financial institutions and businesses. After the FSC decision, Davis writes that two Bitcoin exchanges have started their business on the island. In fact, up to 15 more exchanges are considering making the island a base for their operations, according to Eric Benz of the UK Digital Currency Association.Davis writes that on April 1st, 30 people from the Isle of Man who are interested in Bitcoin will meet to create the Manx Digital Currency Association. This means that some people in the island are getting interested in Bitcoin.At the end of the day, the Isle of Man seems like a good place to commence Bitcoin operations as the island appears to be a fantastic financial hub.For more Bitcoin news, subscribe to CoinReport.Image Source']"

04/05/2014,"['In a highly publicized interview on CNBC, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett dismissed bitcoin as an investment, even going so far as to call it a ""mirage"". In response, tech heavyweight Marc Andreessen says bitcoin is yet another technology Buffett simply doesn\'t understand. While the notion Buffett doesn\'t exactly embrace new technologies may indeed be true, he is right about bitcoin and technological advances in general, at least from an investment perspective. Here is one of the most valuable lessons from Buffett\'s investing style and how you can apply it to your portfolio.Buffett\'s comments and why he made themBuffett said bitcoin is essentially an updated version of writing a check or sending someone a money order. In other words, it\'s simply a new, more efficient way of transmitting money. He\'s not discounting the usefulness of bitcoin to make payments and transfer money, just the intrinsic value it supposedly has as an investment.Andreessen immediately took to Twitter and said how Buffett is always dismissing technologies he doesn\'t understand. This is absolutely true, and he did the same thing during the dot-com bubble. However, he has been right about new technologies as investments.Buffett\'s best adviceIn an article published at the height of the dot-com bubble, Warren Buffett offered his simple definition of what investing is: ""Investing is laying out money now to get more money back in the future -- more money in real terms, after taking inflation into account."" He also pointed out how transforming an industry (like bitcoin may do) doesn\'t necessarily produce a sound investment opportunity. He referenced how the airline and auto industries revolutionized transportation, yet neither has ever been a very sound investment. There have been over 2,000 car manufacturers in U.S. history... how many are still around today?One of the best lessons you can learn from Buffett is how the most important thing to do when investing is to assess the competitive advantage of a company and the durability of the advantage. Does bitcoin have a competitive advantage in the virtual currency business? Absolutely. Will that advantage last for decades? Maybe, but maybe not.So where should the majority of your savings be invested?There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, but a good way to get started is to look at a list of Berkshire Hathaway\'s current holdings.The first thing you should notice is the absence of tech companies, with the exception of IBM which is more of a business-service company these days. Most of Berkshire\'s holdings are in industries like insurance, banking, food and beverage, clothing, materials, and media. These businesses have all been around for centuries (in one form or another) and will be needed for the next 100 years and beyond. People will always need to eat, wear clothes, build homes, get the news, and keep their money safe.However, in this respect, bitcoin could still qualify. They do represent a way for people to transfer money safely, which will always be needed. However, the other thing you\'ll notice is that for every Berkshire holding, it is easy to make the case for a durable competitive advantage. For instance, Wells Fargo has the advantage of one of the highest-quality asset portfolios in the banking sector. Coca Cola offers a diverse portfolio of products and has the advantage of ""economies of scale"", or the cost advantage of mass production. Why is bitcoin more competitive than say, mobile payment software? Most people seem to get along just fine in their lives without bitcoin.Now take a look at your own portfolio. For each company, decide whether their business will be needed in 100 years. If you can\'t say yes with absolute certainty, it wouldn\'t be good enough for Berkshire. Next ask yourself what each company\'s particular competitive advantage is. Any company you are holding as a long-term investment should have a clear answer to this question.Don\'t confuse investing with speculatingI\'m not trying to steer you away from trying to get in on the ""next big thing"". However, this is speculating, not investing. There is absolutely nothing wrong with allocating a small percentage of your portfolio (say 5%) into speculative investments like bitcoin, smartphone companies, OLED display manufacturers, and so on. Putting your money into these companies could absolutely make you tons of money. But they could also go bankrupt in a few years -- there is no way to know for sure.As long as you understand what an investment is, and allocate the majority of your portfolio accordingly, you should be just fine over the long run. You can have a little fun and experiment with potential ""home runs"", but a bunch of base hits over several decades will serve you much better than one or two grand slams.', 'The DATA annual meeting has quite the star studded list of speakers.

I did a lot of compliance and bank regulatory work dealing with issues like deposit, lending, and trust company issues..Before that I was with another bank called Investor’s Bank and Trust, which is also in Boston, doing similar bank regulatory and compliance work.Previously, I was down in Washington DC at The Financial Services Roundtable, which is a trade association for the top 100 financial services companies. I was the Chief Regulatory Counsel. I worked on a variety of issues for banks, securities and insurance firms. I handled legislative and regulatory matters and interfaced with a lot of the agencies on the Federal and State level, including the SEC, banking regulators and the Department of Justice. The focus of this position was government relations and assisting member companies with legal and compliance issues.Can you talk about how you were introduced to Bitcoin?I was approached by our CEO Jeremy Allaire who has built a number of successful technology companies in the past. He described to me his vision for the possibility of digital currencies and Bitcoin and how they could make dramatic changes to the current payment system. He was very aware of the regulatory and compliance issues associated with this industry. He had the foresight to understand that he needed to bring in someone with a strong background in those areas.He approached me and the more I looked at it, I noticed the ability [Bitcoin] had to disrupt the payment space. There are a lot of opportunities under the existing payment system because it isn’t as efficient and cost effective as it should be. The more I looked at digital currency, I saw a real opportunity. And on top of that, seeing Jeremy and his background and our investors and the quality and the depth of the team he has put together along with the board of directors, it was really attractive to make the jump from banking into this arena.If Bitcoin are going to be taxed, what do you think is the best way to tax them?What I can say is that I appreciate [that] the IRS has taken action. The industry as a whole needs certainty around these areas to move forward, from an everyday business standpoint the ability to have auditors audit financials for both companies that are in this space and for consumers who file tax returns. This is important guidance, and I know what the IRS has put out is a good first step.I think more obviously needs to be done. We need to look at the real impacts of this and see what effect it will have as the digital currency matures and we see a lot more payment transactions occur. We’ll need to see what adjustments need to be made to the guidance, because I still think there are enhancements that could be made to what the IRS put out.This is part of the reason why DATA is an important organization, because we need to have everybody at the table the industry and all other constituents like audit firms, regulators, and the IRS looking at this and understanding the consequences of these actions and ensure that we don’t stifle important technological advancements going forward.Do you expect the IRS notice to change based on the feedback they receive this year?I would think so. Most of the regulatory agencies that we have been dealing with in the industry are very receptive to comments and I would not think the IRS would be an exception.It just underscores the importance of the industry having a voice and making sure that they reach out when those meetings take place so that changes can be made.What motivated you to get a law degree?I’ve always had an academic interest in the law for both the US and international legal system. I’ve been interested in all types of law.After I graduated from college, I started my career in the financial services industry and really gravitated towards that space and towards the corporate law perspective. I was always interested in that area. And I pursued not only a legal degree, but also a Masters in Law, Banking, and Financial Law at a program in Boston University where I now teach.Digital currency is certainly cutting edge and there is a lot going on from a regulatory standpoint. I have been no stranger to rapidly changing laws and regulations having just come from banking. With all the changes that happened post-Dodd Frank, it has been interesting ride from a career and academic perspective.If you were to give advice to lawyers who were starting to take on cases related to cryptocurrencies, what type of advice would you give them?What type of cases?The IRS notice was released 2 weeks before taxes are due, so there may be Bitcoin users seeking legal advice for certain matters related to audits and filing taxes.The advice I would give is to understand that this is a rapidly changing space and you will need to do your due diligence so that you have a real understanding of what the issues and implications are. From a legal perspective, not only for the lawyers practicing in this industry but anybody, be transparent with all your dealings with regulatory bodies or law enforcement.For the most part, these types of groups need to understand there are very complicated [cryptocurrency] subjects and there is a lot of education going on back and forth with both groups. It is important to be proactive and transparent when working on these issues.Have you gotten feedback from any banks learning about virtual currencies for the first time?The banking industry is still reticent to work with digital currency firms and to provide banking services for them. There has been somewhat of an initial thaw, but I think they are still trying to understand what the risks are. While banks see potential business opportunities to bank digital currency firms, the risk management and compliance departments are trying to get comfortable with the risks, which is understandable.The other piece on top of that is that these bank’s regulators also need to be comfortable with them banking these digital currency firms. That is why we need more regulatory certainty for both banks and their regulators to get a certain comfortable level.At that point, it becomes a risk management exercise to see if individual companies, like Circle, have appropriate compliance program in place to mitigate risks.Who approached you about becoming a board member for DATA? What was your initial response?I had several conversations with different members within the industry about the possibility. During these conversations it became apparent that because the technology is evolving quickly, and the regulatory issues that impact Bitcoin are so important, there was a need for the industry to combine efforts to collectively and thoughtfully come up with a set of best practices. We also wanted to have a collective unified approach to interfacing with regulators, lawmakers and others. It is an important that we have that unified voice.Based on my background, I thought I could contribute to that effort. I thought it was worthwhile to try to be elected to a board seat. Hopefully, now that we have a board in place are starting to develop best practices and other frameworks for the industry, we’ll have a positive impact going forward.In Edan’s interview, he said DATA wouldn’t just focus on the US, but help other industries and governments around the world. Is your plan to focus more on the US this year or will you scatter your efforts in different parts of the world?Bitcoin and digital currencies are a global technology and could bring a global change in payment systems. Therefore, I think we have to focus on both US and international regulatory regimes. We need to be proactive and focus efforts where there is action happening now. A lot of that is happening at the state and federal level in the US, but it’s also happening at an international level.We are going to work with anyone who is willing to work with us and listen to us. It has been encouraging at this point, because there has been a definite willingness and interest in this space.We are still at a very nascent stage with this technology, and you are seeing quite a bit of broad interest. I think it is a very positive thing. I think we will get to a place that makes sense and allows the technology to evolve, thrive, and get to the next level.This interview is part of a series of interviews of the DATA board members Edan Yago, Patrick Murck, Constance Choi, John Beccia, and Stan Stalnaker.The DATA annual meeting will be in Washington DC on April 10-11.

In a nutshell, one is a loser and the other is a winner.In the late 2000s, the two battled it out on store shelves in what is known as a format war. Which won? Here’s a hint: you won’t be watching Gravity on HD DVD anytime soon.Any cryptocurrency enthusiast looking back at the HD DVD vs Blu-ray format war is bound to wonder: ""Must a single coin similarly emerge a \'winner\' – whatever that means in the context of cryptocurrency?"".The argument in favor of warIf you were to view the cryptocurrency format from this perspective, bitcoin would be the clear front-runner. A few other coins – dogecoin, peercoin and litecoin – would be trailing close behind. Additionally, depending on who you ask, there might be other legitimate contenders to add into the fray.Unfortunately, the wide variety of coins may actually be hindering cryptocurrency rather than helping its cause. When HD DVD and Blu-ray were duking it out to be the industry standard, sales of both were ultimately hurt. Consumers were afraid to buy a player or discs of either one, wary they would commit to the format that eventually lost the fight.“The market for cryptocurrency involves everyone that uses money: it’s everyone.”If this thinking holds true for cryptocurrencies, then the availability of so many coins may deter people (especially non-techies) from buying into any single coin.As a result, many will simply adopt a wait-and-see approach, especially as one cryptocurrency is bound to emerge on top.The alternatives are just too risky for them: if they buy into a single coin, there is a chance that they are betting on the wrong one. If they buy into multiple coins, their chances of picking the right coin increases, but so does the likelihood that they are committing time, effort, and money to others that will be worthless in the future.Thus, the case can be made that altcoins are actually hurting the future of cryptocurrency rather than raising some sort of crucial cultural awareness.In keeping with this, it could be argued that the current diversity of coins is a stage in our evolution we must overcome. For cryptocurrency to see wider adoption, we must make it as easy as possible for people to adopt it: this means one coin.Cryptocurrency is not at warI would not be one of those people.I don’t see cryptocurrency as a true format war. In a true format war, the competing technologies must be in mutually exclusive competition. In the case of HD DVD and Blu-ray, a person had to choose between the two. If you bought a HD DVD player, you couldn\'t play films on Blu-ray, and vice versa. Thus, the consumers who bought HD DVD players and movies \'lost\', while the consumers who bought Blu-ray players and movies \'won\'.The case with cryptocurrency is not so cut-and-dry. Even if one coin emerges as dominant – and bitcoin doesn\'t look like it will lose its lead anytime soon – there will never be a true \'winner\'. Unlike hardware, there is no real incentive for the stakeholders in cryptocurrency to switch over wholesale to a single coin. Thus, many people can – and do – trade in multiple coins.What’s more, and this may sound like a bold pronouncement – unless you’re a true believer – the cryptocurrency market is even larger than the one that HD DVD and Blu-ray locked horns over. That market was people that wanted to watch films in high-definition at home.The market for cryptocurrency involves everyone that uses money. It’s everyone. So in addition to not being in mutually exclusive competition with one another, the various coins are operating in an exponentially larger market. And within that market, the coins tend to cater to different segments, given that each coin has its own strengths and weaknesses, peculiarities and protocols.Why this comparison mattersSo why is it important to invoke the HD DVD vs Blu-ray format war if cryptocurrency is not locked into a similar battle? Too many people treat cryptocurrencies as though the various coins are pitted against one another in a winner-take-all scheme. Thus, they throw their support and enthusiasm behind a single coin, proclaiming it \'superior\'.The truth is: it’s the superior coin for them. Each has its place in the cryptocurrency landscape, so treating any one of them as above the rest is as silly as a stockbroker only advocating for the purchase of one particular stock.Just as stockbrokers take it upon themselves to encourage the importance of investment in general, we must promote cryptocurrency as a whole – through whatever coin or coins people wish to use as their cryptocurrency of choice.Companies in the cryptocurrency space must be similarly open to working with a variety of coins. Yes, it makes sense for them to start with a single coin, which in most cases is bitcoin, but they must view the eventual inclusion of other coins as a boon and not a drain on their business models.Take, for example, mining equipment companies. Many of them, right now, sell just bitcoin miners, but some are looking to release multi-currency mining devices.Work of this sort, that seeks to innovate and enlighten across the cryptocurrency space rather than with just a single coin, is crucial to the development of cryptocurrency. The work acknowledges that our future is not tied to a single coin, but to embracing the diversity of coins that the market offers. I hope that we, the early adopters, are among the first to get on board with this idea as well.Battle image via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Läs mer om cookies här.Jag förstår.']","['In a highly publicized interview on CNBC, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett dismissed bitcoin as an investment, even going so far as to call it a ""mirage"". In response, tech heavyweight Marc Andreessen says bitcoin is yet another technology Buffett simply doesn\'t understand. While the notion Buffett doesn\'t exactly embrace new technologies may indeed be true, he is right about bitcoin and technological advances in general, at least from an investment perspective. Here is one of the most valuable lessons from Buffett\'s investing style and how you can apply it to your portfolio.Buffett\'s comments and why he made themBuffett said bitcoin is essentially an updated version of writing a check or sending someone a money order. In other words, it\'s simply a new, more efficient way of transmitting money. He\'s not discounting the usefulness of bitcoin to make payments and transfer money, just the intrinsic value it supposedly has as an investment.Andreessen immediately took to Twitter and said how Buffett is always dismissing technologies he doesn\'t understand. This is absolutely true, and he did the same thing during the dot-com bubble. However, he has been right about new technologies as investments.Buffett\'s best adviceIn an article published at the height of the dot-com bubble, Warren Buffett offered his simple definition of what investing is: ""Investing is laying out money now to get more money back in the future -- more money in real terms, after taking inflation into account."" He also pointed out how transforming an industry (like bitcoin may do) doesn\'t necessarily produce a sound investment opportunity. He referenced how the airline and auto industries revolutionized transportation, yet neither has ever been a very sound investment. There have been over 2,000 car manufacturers in U.S. history... how many are still around today?One of the best lessons you can learn from Buffett is how the most important thing to do when investing is to assess the competitive advantage of a company and the durability of the advantage. Does bitcoin have a competitive advantage in the virtual currency business? Absolutely. Will that advantage last for decades? Maybe, but maybe not.So where should the majority of your savings be invested?There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, but a good way to get started is to look at a list of Berkshire Hathaway\'s current holdings.The first thing you should notice is the absence of tech companies, with the exception of IBM which is more of a business-service company these days. Most of Berkshire\'s holdings are in industries like insurance, banking, food and beverage, clothing, materials, and media. These businesses have all been around for centuries (in one form or another) and will be needed for the next 100 years and beyond. People will always need to eat, wear clothes, build homes, get the news, and keep their money safe.However, in this respect, bitcoin could still qualify. They do represent a way for people to transfer money safely, which will always be needed. However, the other thing you\'ll notice is that for every Berkshire holding, it is easy to make the case for a durable competitive advantage. For instance, Wells Fargo has the advantage of one of the highest-quality asset portfolios in the banking sector. Coca Cola offers a diverse portfolio of products and has the advantage of ""economies of scale"", or the cost advantage of mass production. Why is bitcoin more competitive than say, mobile payment software? Most people seem to get along just fine in their lives without bitcoin.Now take a look at your own portfolio. For each company, decide whether their business will be needed in 100 years. If you can\'t say yes with absolute certainty, it wouldn\'t be good enough for Berkshire. Next ask yourself what each company\'s particular competitive advantage is. Any company you are holding as a long-term investment should have a clear answer to this question.Don\'t confuse investing with speculatingI\'m not trying to steer you away from trying to get in on the ""next big thing"". However, this is speculating, not investing. There is absolutely nothing wrong with allocating a small percentage of your portfolio (say 5%) into speculative investments like bitcoin, smartphone companies, OLED display manufacturers, and so on. Putting your money into these companies could absolutely make you tons of money. But they could also go bankrupt in a few years -- there is no way to know for sure.As long as you understand what an investment is, and allocate the majority of your portfolio accordingly, you should be just fine over the long run. You can have a little fun and experiment with potential ""home runs"", but a bunch of base hits over several decades will serve you much better than one or two grand slams.', 'The DATA annual meeting has quite the star studded list of speakers.

04/11/2014,"['The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, currently moving towards regulatory approval, could be approved by the end of 2014 and will be a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), with each share representing an amount of bitcoin held by the Trust. Currently, such an investment vehicle is only available to wealthy investors, through funds like the Bitcoin Investment Trust. The Winklevoss ETF will allow people with a brokerage account to invest in Bitcoin without having to worry about the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping bitcoin. (Read Investopedia\'s exclusive interview with Tyler Winklevoss.)Proposed in 2013, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust was the first Bitcoin ETF to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but the Bitcoin Investment Trust announced plans in early 2014 to release an over-the-counter Bitcoin ETF. The latter is taking a different regulatory approach that does not require approval from the SEC, and has projected a launch in the fourth quarter of 2014.What is an ETF?ETF stands for exchange-traded fund, and is an investment fund that tracks an index, specific asset or basket of assets. Many aspects of the market are covered by ETFs. First introduced in 1989, ETFs are similar to index funds, but unlike index funds, ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the day on the stock exchange. They have low management fees, sometimes as low as 0.04%.Background on the Winklevoss TwinsThe Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, gained notoriety through their lawsuit against the Menlo Park, Calif.-based Facebook Inc. (Nasdaq:FB), from which they were awarded $20 million in cash and $45 million in Facebook stock in February 2008. They rowed for the U.S. at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, went on to Oxford University\'s business school in the U.K., graduating in 2010, and then became venture capitalists. In April 2013, they claimed to own 1% of all Bitcoin in existence. On July 1, 2013, their company Math-Based Asset Services filed with the SEC a Form S-1 Registration Statement proposing the creation of a Bitcoin ETF called the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust.Motivations for a Bitcoin ETFThe S-1 filing describes shares of the ETF to be ""Easily Accessible and Cost Efficient."" By offering a product that can be bought on an exchange, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust will allow investors to avoid the process of purchasing bitcoins on exchanges and having to handle storage. The ETF price will also be based on a blended bitcoin price that reflects the volume-weighted average of top exchanges from across the world, whose current exchange rates can differ, and some of which may be difficult for investors to access. Bitcoins can currently be bought on exchanges and through companies like Coinbase, but typically, set-up is required that requires the linking of a bank account and some level of identity verification. Furthermore, secure storage of bitcoins by placing them into cold storage - that is, in wallets that are kept disconnected from the internet - can be technically challenging and investors may not want to take the responsibility of handling this.A Bitcoin ETF traded on an exchange will give investors ways to implement various investment strategies such as shorting the ETF and buying it on margin. Brokerages may also offer the ability to buy and sell options. Furthermore, the release of a Bitcoin ETF will give Bitcoin exposure to the investing mainstream and add to its validity as a store of value and as a currency.The WinkdexAn amendment to the S-1 SEC filing was filed on February 19, 2013, and it included an announcement of the Winklevoss Index, or Winkdex. The Winkdex is a price index for Bitcoin. From winkdex.com: The index is ""calculated by blending the trading prices in U.S. dollars for the top three (by volume) qualified Bitcoin Exchanges during the previous two-hour period using a volume-weighted exponential moving average. This proprietary formula weighs transactions proportionally by volume as well as exponentially by time to give greater weight both to the higher volume transactions and more recent transactions."" The top three exchanges by volume are selected from a set of five exchanges based on the volume exchanged over the previous 24-hour period.CriticismSome might argue the ETF provides no value if one can buy and hold bitcoin on a service like Coinbase without having to incur the recurring fees associated with the ETF. Coinbase is a San Fransisco, Calif.-based company, backed by renowned venture capitalists such as Andreessen Horowitz, that provides Bitcoin services to consumers and merchants. For a one-time fee, consumers can purchase bitcoin on Coinbase. However, a Bitcoin ETF will allow investors the ability to exercise different investment strategies regarding Bitcoin that are not currently available in the U.S.The Bottom LineThe Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, originally proposed to the SEC on July 1, 2013, is currently working its way toward regulatory approval. When approved, its shares will be issued at a price arrived at through a volume-weighted average of the Bitcoin price on leading Bitcoin exchanges across the world. Anyone with access to a brokerage account will be able to purchase shares or exercise other investment strategies made available by the brokerage.', 'It\'s a special edition of the bitcoin ATM roundup this week as Robocoin went to Washington, DC, a couple of new players entered the European market via Finland and Slovenia and Quebec City received two bitcoin \'guichets automatique.\'Washington, DC USASurrounded by reporters and camera crews from some of the world\'s largest news organisations, more than 50 members of the US Congress lined up in Rayburn House on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC to test a Robocoin ATM.Presented by Robocoin\'s management team at the invitation of Representative Jared Polis (D-CO), the Robocoin machine received an enthusiastic response from other members.Polis said:""The innovation of online currency will be an important economic driver for the future that allows people and companies to reduce transaction costs and facilitate international transactions.""He added that it is physical cash, not bitcoin, that presents the easiest opportunity to hide illicit activity.Charleston, SC, USAAnother US Robocoin appeared in Charleston, South Carolina, at the Dig South Interactive Technology Festival.

""If this is really going to be a global protocol, it needs that [team].""He added:""In the bitcoin world I’d say a lot of that value is going into mining. Whereas we’re focusing that stream of monetization towards building that team.""ConsensusThe concept of bitcoin mining is what has made that network itself so powerful.At the time of writing, bitcoin\'s global network power is around the 48PH/s mark. However, all of that mining power requires electricity (and money) in order to complete blocks and transactions.With the Ripple protocol, that type of consensus is conducted without any monetary incentive and instead relies on gateways to move money along with something called validators, which establish trust within the network.The company\'s CTO Stefan Thomas says that unlike Ripple, bitcoin mining could potentially result in serious issues down the road:""The nice thing about not having an incentive is you avoid a whole string of economic problems where people are trying to game the system just to get to the incentive.""People who have an interest in seeing Ripple succeed are better off with its protocol than a monetary incentive, at least from Ripple Labs\' perspective.Thomas makes a comparison with the concept of ISPs. They are \'stakeholders\' in the internet, but do not directly own a piece of it. This, Ripple believes, is a prime example of how a truly global payment protocol should operate.Its open-source nature also means that Ripple could change this in the future, although it doesn\'t plan to just yet, Thomas added:""If we need an incentive, we can add one. But its reasonable to start out without one and see how far you get.""Removing barriersEven with today\'s technology, it remains unrelentingly difficult to move money around the globe. Ripple plans to change this by building the best currency-agnostic payment protocol for financial companies to use.According to the company, an international bank transfer today from the US to India might look something like this:Ripple\'s use of distributed gateways and market makers could make this process much easier.It would also benefit the community within a system that supports the Ripple protocol instead of banks just making fees from clearing, settlement and currency exchange:What appears different at face value is that one company essentially replaces the role of several banks.But the reality is that Ripple Labs\' plan is only to develop its payment protocol, and allow an ecosystem around it to take the place of the traditional banking system to create shorter transaction paths. Thomas added:""What Ripple looks for is the shortest connection between your account and the other person’s.""XRPA payment system of any kind needs a unit of account. Existing digital payment systems, such as PayPal, use fiat money like the US dollar.But here\'s where PayPal runs into a problem: with so many countries using different forms of government money, PayPal has to separate its businesses by each country that it does business in.This makes for a relatively inefficient global platform. For example, with PayPal, one person cannot send Chinese Yuan to another who wants to receive bitcoin.However, Ripple can do just that, and it uses its own method of account called XRP to help facilitate ""pathways"" to find a route of least resistance to move value around.Because there is no mining, XRP, also known as a Ripple, has already been allocated within the protocol.According to the company-owned Ripplecharts, there are approximately 100 billion XRP within the system. The idea is that as the protocol becomes popular, XRP will be needed as a unit of account for stakeholders to push value through the system.XRP, in this way, is not designed to be an effective currency. ""It’s designed for a very specific purpose, it doesn’t have to be very fancy,"" said Thomas, the CTO.He added:""It [XRP] doesn’t have to be very good [as a currency] in order to fulfil that anti-spam measure purpose for which it’s designed.""Gateways and the protocolXRP\'s use is to help build up Ripple as a protocol, but without Ripple gateways there wouldn\'t be any way to move money in and out of the system.Gateways are similar to what exchanges do for the Bitcoin network in the way it allows people to trade currencies.Right now, the most popular Ripple gateway is owned by Bitstamp, the exchange that has reportedly raised $10m from Pantera Capital, an all-bitcoin investment fund backed by Fortress Investments, Benchmark Partners and Ribbit Capital.Gateways are the key to regulatory hurdles that many new financial technologies such as Ripple face. Thomas added:""The idea is that rather than us worrying about some global compliance strategy we provide the language, the graph for the different relationships. And then the gateway operators, they know their local jurisdiction.""Identity and complianceWith compliance comes the question of identity verification. And that poses another potential problem Ripple is trying to tackle: leaving know your customer (KYC) to all of its gateways would prove rather problematic.Anyone who has done business with more than one bitcoin exchange has dealt with verifying identity documents over and over again. This is an issue that Ripple is working to solve.Greg Kidd, Ripple\'s chief risk officer and a former director at Promontory Financial Group, said:""There’s sort of the balance between security, knowing everything about everybody. And then there’s privacy, knowing nothing about anyone.""The idea Ripple has is to use OpenID connect to be able to allow people to have a digital payments profile. This would give people ownership over their own financial history – and it could potentially be used globally, even for people in countries that don\'t use credit scores.Said Kidd:""It means everybody in the world can have a payment identity. And they own it – that’s the cool thing, not the government, not the bank.""Moving moneySince Ripple wants to be a payment platform, it is courting developers and bitcoin enthusiasts to get involved.Some cryptocurrency investors have realized the potential to move cryptocoins and currencies from one place to another, said Thomas:""Our biggest constituency and the people who get the most value out of the system are bitcoiners trying to move money between different exchanges.""Andrew White, who won a Ripple contest at a developer event for his \'One Million Gateways\' concept, believes his idea is an example of the potential that exists for the protocol to be used to move money much easier than every before:""I believe One Million Gateways will be used for prototyping services by enterprises looking to get into the space.""Services that could use the concept include remittances businesses, currency exchanges and payment processors.Users don\'t necessarily need to know that Ripple is being used as the ""pipe"" but companies could use Ripple to facilitate these types of transactions.Smart ContractsSeveral efforts already exist to implement smart contracts that don\'t require a third party.Ideas like Ethereum and colored coins exist because block chain technology allows for a system of enforcing contracts to protect the average person like never before.The rise of legal technicalities like arbitration clauses have inadvertently taken away rights from consumers to fight contracts in court. However, smart contracts offer more logic and less legal minutiae.Ripple is working on a smart contract enforcement system that will compliment its payment protocol.Said Thomas:""You have to come up with interfaces, between the sandbox where these contracts are running and the rest of the network functionalities.""If smart contracts are to be adopted, they have be trusted. This is something that Thomas has spent over two years thinking about, and the best system that he has found relies on x86 machine code that is very tight, meaning it has no flaws conceptually.Thomas says that Ripple will use Google\'s Native Client, a solution that directly uses hardware-based machine code:""What Native Client does, the sandbox that it uses, it relies on this mathematical model which means that you can verify that it won’t break out of the sandbox.""Native Client could be the best way to enforce a digital contract with low-level control, by using a very small codebase as a ""sandbox"" to protect from any abnormalities that could happen at a higher, web-based level.Focus on protocolThere have been numerous detractors that have dismissed Ripple because it doesn\'t operate like most other cryptocurrencies.But other than bitcoin, litecoin and perhaps dogecoin, most crytpocurrencies aren\'t payment mechanisms anyhow.Ripple\'s focus on developing an open-source core payment protocol is different because there is no central figure directing the course of development. The company currently has eight core protocol developers, and is looking for more.There is also a startup accelerator. CrossCoin Ventures, an independent entity but up two floors from the Ripple HQ, is looking for talent that can leverage the protocol.LibraTax, a company that does virtual currency tax returns, is the first tenet there. The impact of having a protocol prepared for mass adoption is something that developers should not dismiss, according to Larson, the Ripple CEO:""The protocol can just exist. That kind of macro opportunity should not be wasted.""Relying on a community of developers, investors and financial companies is what Ripple is trying to foster. At the same time, focusing on the core technical aspects of its payment protocol is the company\'s real goal.Ripple is hoping that the rest will be taken care of by those who seek an opportunity to change the current system of financial payments and contract enforcement.""That’s the beauty of it,"" said Asheesh Birla, the company\'s head of product. There are a lot of options to be involved with Ripple: Gateway, market maker or app developer leveraging the Ripple API, he said:""You can either do all of it, or you can separate it out and leverage the existing ecosystem.""Featured Image by CoinDeskThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The Bitcoin Price Index as of 9 a.m. on April 10 was $411.13 USD.At this moment, computers around the world are racing to solve complex algorithms. Whoever wins earns the prize of 25 newly created bitcoins. This digital money can then be traded or used to buy goods directly.But running all those math formulas to make this cyber-currency takes a lot of electricity. And that in turn takes us to central Washington. The largest “Bitcoin mine” in North America can be found on the outskirts of Wenatchee, Washington.For the Here & Now Contributors Network, Tom Banse of Northwest News Network paid a visit.ReporterTom Banse is a regional correspondent for Northwest News Network. He tweets @TomBanse.Copyright 2014 WBUR-FM. To see more, visit http://www.wbur.orgTranscriptJEREMY HOBSON, HOST:Well, the alternative currency bitcoin got a bit of a boost this week from the establishment. At an event showcasing a bitcoin ATM on Capitol Hill, Jared Polis, a Democratic congressman from Colorado, became the first member of Congress to buy bitcoin. Polis spent $10 to get .02 btc. He said he was going to buy a pair of socks.Well, despite the endorsement, the price of bitcoin fell about $50 today following announcements from bitcoin exchanges in China that they will be suspending bank transfers. So if you\'re still trying to get your head around bitcoin, I don\'t blame you. It\'s relatively new, and most of us don\'t use it or even know where it comes from.That would be a bitcoin mine, not a mine like we think of traditionally. It\'s a datacenter. The largest bitcoin mine in North America is located on the outskirts of Wenatchee in Washington State. It is two warehouses converted into a datacenter where computers solve complex algorithms to produce the virtual currency.From the HERE AND NOW contributors network, Tom Banse reports.TOM BANSE: OK, so we\'re going to go into what\'s called a mine, but we don\'t have tools or helmets or lamps.DAVE CARLSON: Yeah, there\'s no pickaxes here.BANSE: No, OK.CARLSON: There\'s no danger of cave-in.BANSE: I\'m talking with Dave Carlson. He\'s the CEO of mine operator MegaBigPower. Carlson leads me through the unmarked door of what looks from the outside like a cold-storage warehouse.OK, we can feel the air moving right behind us, big floor fans. The sound you hear behind us.CARLSON: And that\'s all just to try to pull the heat out as best we can from all of this equipment.BANSE: So where are the miners?CARLSON: This is a miner right here. All of these green boards have arrays of computer chips on them. And each computer chip is doing the processing required to make a little bit of bitcoin. As you can see, we have them massively arrayed. There are thousands and thousands of boards here.BANSE: All those digital mining rigs are chipping away at the complex mathematical puzzles cooked up by the still unknown developers of bitcoin. The miners want to win the prize for having the right solution at the right time. Every 10 minutes there are 25 new bitcoins up for grabs.CARLSON: It used to be when we first fired these off, they had some sort of residual oils and things from assembly. And it would burn off, and so, you know, that was the smell of money when we first started firing these things up.BANSE: Both the miners and the global bitcoin community win from this furious number crunching because the act of mining contributes processor power to verify and secure the public ledger of bitcoin transactions. Carlson initially got into bitcoin mining as a hobby in 2012.

Electricity rates in central Washington State run less than a quarter of the national average.

Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.', 'Bitkoinai – daugiausiai jaunimo (18–27 m.) naudojama skaitmeninė valiuta, kuri, pasak J.Matonio turi aibę privalumų, lyginant su įprastinėmis – mokant bitkoinais nėra bankinio mokesčio, mokėjimai vykdomi visiškai anonimiškai ir neįmanoma atsekti, kas pirko prekes. Be to, ši valiuta apsaugo nuo infliacijos.Bitkoinų nauda prekybininkams – galimybė pasiekti net ir tolimiausiose šalyse, kur nėra „Visa“, „MasterCard“ ,arba tiems, kas nesinaudoja bankinėmis paslaugomis.Tiesa, antra medalio pusė ta, kad valiuta nuolat svyruoja – per pastarąjį pusmetį bitkoino vertė buvo pakilusi iki 1250 dolerių, dabar ji siekia maždaug 400. Be to, ja aktyviai prekiaujama didžiausioje internetinėje parduotuvėje „Silk Road“.Ar apsimoka pirkti bitkoinus ir kaip jie pakeis mūsų supratimą apie pinigus, klausiame J.Matonio.– Bitkoinai – alternatyva ir konkurentams bankams. Kaip manote, kaip per dešimtmetį ši valiuta pakeis bankininkystę?– Manau, kad bitkoinai ją praturtins. Bitkoinai suteiks daug galimybių įprastiems bankams – jei bankai įtrauks juos į savo veiklą, turės galimybių uždirbti, pavyzdžiui, keisdami juos į įprastines valiutas. Tačiau bankams trukdys centriniai bankai – jie gali prarasti daugiau, todėl visais būdais priešinasi virtualioms valiutoms.Ateityje bankai grįš prie to, ką ir turi daryti – išduoti paskolas ir imti indėlius. Jie daugiau nebespekuliuos valiutomis ir nebeužsiims kita išvestine veikla.– Daug kabėjote apie bitkoinų privalumus, tačiau su jais susiję ir daug nusikaltimų, pavyzdžiui, atsiskaitymai jais sudarė didžiausią dalį pirkimų internetinėje narkotikų prekybos platformoje „Silk Road“.– Šia valiuta buvo pradavinėjami ne tik nelegalūs produktai. Buvo atvejų, kai žmonės „Silk Road“ bitkoinais pirko vaistus, kurių negalėjo gauti kitais būdais. Taigi aš tikrai nesutinku, kad visa tai yra vien neigiama.Žinoma, valiuta buvo naudota ir blogiems dalykams, tačiau turime suprasti, kad valiuta neturi moralės – blogus dalykus daro žmonės, o ne valiutos.– Minėjote, kad Argentinoje bitkoinais laikomos santaupos žmonėms padėjo apsisaugoti nuo infliacijos, o Kipre – netikėtų valdžios sprendimų apmokestinti indėlius. Tačiau ar išties pastovios kainos neturintys bitkoinai, kurių vertė per pusmetį sumažėjo trečdaliu, yra geriausias būdas apsisaugoti?– Trumpuoju laikotarpiu yra išties daug kainų svyravimų. Tačiau ilguoju laikotarpiu Argentinoje kur kas labiau apsimokėjo investuoti į bitkoinus, negu į Argentinos valiutą – pesą. Tie žmonės, kurie perka bitkoinus, žiūri penkis ar dešimt metų į priekį. Be to, į bitkoinus galima investuoti ir dalį savo pinigų.– Ar, jūsų nuomone, yra kitų virtualių valiutų, kurios galėtų nukonkuruoti bitkoinus?– Dabar yra daugiau kaip šimtas kriptovaliutų, tačiau visos jos yra išvestos iš bitkoinų – visos jos paėmė bitkoinų kodą ir kažką jame pakeitė. Yra „dosecoin“, „litecoin“ ir t.t. Tačiau jos nėra tokios patikimos ir saugios. Jos daugiau yra tarsi žaidimai, kitos yra padarytos visiškai juokais, jas yra labai lengva nulaužti.– Daugelyje šalių bitkoinai yra draudžiami. Kaip manote, ar pasikeis vyriausybių požiūris į šią valiutą?– Aš tuo labai abejoju. Tačiau šalys, kurios bitkoinus priims, tikrai išloš. Galvokime apie bitkoinus kaip apie internetinį pokerį, kuris kai kuriose šalyse draudžiamas. Bet tam tikrose šalyse jis leidžiamos ir labai sustiprina ekonomiką – pavyzdžiui, Maltoje. Tas pats bus ir su bitkoinu, jei ši valiuta nėra laukiama vienoje šalyje, ji bus laukiama kitoje. Šalis, kuri atmes bitkoinus, praloš, o bitkoinai vis tiek taps populiarūs kažkur kitur.']","['The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, currently moving towards regulatory approval, could be approved by the end of 2014 and will be a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), with each share representing an amount of bitcoin held by the Trust. Currently, such an investment vehicle is only available to wealthy investors, through funds like the Bitcoin Investment Trust. The Winklevoss ETF will allow people with a brokerage account to invest in Bitcoin without having to worry about the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping bitcoin. (Read Investopedia\'s exclusive interview with Tyler Winklevoss.)Proposed in 2013, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust was the first Bitcoin ETF to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but the Bitcoin Investment Trust announced plans in early 2014 to release an over-the-counter Bitcoin ETF. The latter is taking a different regulatory approach that does not require approval from the SEC, and has projected a launch in the fourth quarter of 2014.What is an ETF?ETF stands for exchange-traded fund, and is an investment fund that tracks an index, specific asset or basket of assets. Many aspects of the market are covered by ETFs. First introduced in 1989, ETFs are similar to index funds, but unlike index funds, ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the day on the stock exchange. They have low management fees, sometimes as low as 0.04%.Background on the Winklevoss TwinsThe Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, gained notoriety through their lawsuit against the Menlo Park, Calif.-based Facebook Inc. (Nasdaq:FB), from which they were awarded $20 million in cash and $45 million in Facebook stock in February 2008. They rowed for the U.S. at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, went on to Oxford University\'s business school in the U.K., graduating in 2010, and then became venture capitalists. In April 2013, they claimed to own 1% of all Bitcoin in existence. On July 1, 2013, their company Math-Based Asset Services filed with the SEC a Form S-1 Registration Statement proposing the creation of a Bitcoin ETF called the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust.Motivations for a Bitcoin ETFThe S-1 filing describes shares of the ETF to be ""Easily Accessible and Cost Efficient."" By offering a product that can be bought on an exchange, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust will allow investors to avoid the process of purchasing bitcoins on exchanges and having to handle storage. The ETF price will also be based on a blended bitcoin price that reflects the volume-weighted average of top exchanges from across the world, whose current exchange rates can differ, and some of which may be difficult for investors to access. Bitcoins can currently be bought on exchanges and through companies like Coinbase, but typically, set-up is required that requires the linking of a bank account and some level of identity verification. Furthermore, secure storage of bitcoins by placing them into cold storage - that is, in wallets that are kept disconnected from the internet - can be technically challenging and investors may not want to take the responsibility of handling this.A Bitcoin ETF traded on an exchange will give investors ways to implement various investment strategies such as shorting the ETF and buying it on margin. Brokerages may also offer the ability to buy and sell options. Furthermore, the release of a Bitcoin ETF will give Bitcoin exposure to the investing mainstream and add to its validity as a store of value and as a currency.The WinkdexAn amendment to the S-1 SEC filing was filed on February 19, 2013, and it included an announcement of the Winklevoss Index, or Winkdex. The Winkdex is a price index for Bitcoin. From winkdex.com: The index is ""calculated by blending the trading prices in U.S. dollars for the top three (by volume) qualified Bitcoin Exchanges during the previous two-hour period using a volume-weighted exponential moving average. This proprietary formula weighs transactions proportionally by volume as well as exponentially by time to give greater weight both to the higher volume transactions and more recent transactions."" The top three exchanges by volume are selected from a set of five exchanges based on the volume exchanged over the previous 24-hour period.CriticismSome might argue the ETF provides no value if one can buy and hold bitcoin on a service like Coinbase without having to incur the recurring fees associated with the ETF. Coinbase is a San Fransisco, Calif.-based company, backed by renowned venture capitalists such as Andreessen Horowitz, that provides Bitcoin services to consumers and merchants. For a one-time fee, consumers can purchase bitcoin on Coinbase. However, a Bitcoin ETF will allow investors the ability to exercise different investment strategies regarding Bitcoin that are not currently available in the U.S.The Bottom LineThe Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, originally proposed to the SEC on July 1, 2013, is currently working its way toward regulatory approval. When approved, its shares will be issued at a price arrived at through a volume-weighted average of the Bitcoin price on leading Bitcoin exchanges across the world. Anyone with access to a brokerage account will be able to purchase shares or exercise other investment strategies made available by the brokerage.', 'It\'s a special edition of the bitcoin ATM roundup this week as Robocoin went to Washington, DC, a couple of new players entered the European market via Finland and Slovenia and Quebec City received two bitcoin \'guichets automatique.\'Washington, DC USASurrounded by reporters and camera crews from some of the world\'s largest news organisations, more than 50 members of the US Congress lined up in Rayburn House on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC to test a Robocoin ATM.Presented by Robocoin\'s management team at the invitation of Representative Jared Polis (D-CO), the Robocoin machine received an enthusiastic response from other members.Polis said:""The innovation of online currency will be an important economic driver for the future that allows people and companies to reduce transaction costs and facilitate international transactions.""He added that it is physical cash, not bitcoin, that presents the easiest opportunity to hide illicit activity.Charleston, SC, USAAnother US Robocoin appeared in Charleston, South Carolina, at the Dig South Interactive Technology Festival.

""If this is really going to be a global protocol, it needs that [team].""He added:""In the bitcoin world I’d say a lot of that value is going into mining. Whereas we’re focusing that stream of monetization towards building that team.""ConsensusThe concept of bitcoin mining is what has made that network itself so powerful.At the time of writing, bitcoin\'s global network power is around the 48PH/s mark. However, all of that mining power requires electricity (and money) in order to complete blocks and transactions.With the Ripple protocol, that type of consensus is conducted without any monetary incentive and instead relies on gateways to move money along with something called validators, which establish trust within the network.The company\'s CTO Stefan Thomas says that unlike Ripple, bitcoin mining could potentially result in serious issues down the road:""The nice thing about not having an incentive is you avoid a whole string of economic problems where people are trying to game the system just to get to the incentive.""People who have an interest in seeing Ripple succeed are better off with its protocol than a monetary incentive, at least from Ripple Labs\' perspective.Thomas makes a comparison with the concept of ISPs. They are \'stakeholders\' in the internet, but do not directly own a piece of it. This, Ripple believes, is a prime example of how a truly global payment protocol should operate.Its open-source nature also means that Ripple could change this in the future, although it doesn\'t plan to just yet, Thomas added:""If we need an incentive, we can add one. But its reasonable to start out without one and see how far you get.""Removing barriersEven with today\'s technology, it remains unrelentingly difficult to move money around the globe. Ripple plans to change this by building the best currency-agnostic payment protocol for financial companies to use.According to the company, an international bank transfer today from the US to India might look something like this:Ripple\'s use of distributed gateways and market makers could make this process much easier.It would also benefit the community within a system that supports the Ripple protocol instead of banks just making fees from clearing, settlement and currency exchange:What appears different at face value is that one company essentially replaces the role of several banks.But the reality is that Ripple Labs\' plan is only to develop its payment protocol, and allow an ecosystem around it to take the place of the traditional banking system to create shorter transaction paths. Thomas added:""What Ripple looks for is the shortest connection between your account and the other person’s.""XRPA payment system of any kind needs a unit of account. Existing digital payment systems, such as PayPal, use fiat money like the US dollar.But here\'s where PayPal runs into a problem: with so many countries using different forms of government money, PayPal has to separate its businesses by each country that it does business in.This makes for a relatively inefficient global platform. For example, with PayPal, one person cannot send Chinese Yuan to another who wants to receive bitcoin.However, Ripple can do just that, and it uses its own method of account called XRP to help facilitate ""pathways"" to find a route of least resistance to move value around.Because there is no mining, XRP, also known as a Ripple, has already been allocated within the protocol.According to the company-owned Ripplecharts, there are approximately 100 billion XRP within the system. The idea is that as the protocol becomes popular, XRP will be needed as a unit of account for stakeholders to push value through the system.XRP, in this way, is not designed to be an effective currency. ""It’s designed for a very specific purpose, it doesn’t have to be very fancy,"" said Thomas, the CTO.He added:""It [XRP] doesn’t have to be very good [as a currency] in order to fulfil that anti-spam measure purpose for which it’s designed.""Gateways and the protocolXRP\'s use is to help build up Ripple as a protocol, but without Ripple gateways there wouldn\'t be any way to move money in and out of the system.Gateways are similar to what exchanges do for the Bitcoin network in the way it allows people to trade currencies.Right now, the most popular Ripple gateway is owned by Bitstamp, the exchange that has reportedly raised $10m from Pantera Capital, an all-bitcoin investment fund backed by Fortress Investments, Benchmark Partners and Ribbit Capital.Gateways are the key to regulatory hurdles that many new financial technologies such as Ripple face. Thomas added:""The idea is that rather than us worrying about some global compliance strategy we provide the language, the graph for the different relationships. And then the gateway operators, they know their local jurisdiction.""Identity and complianceWith compliance comes the question of identity verification. And that poses another potential problem Ripple is trying to tackle: leaving know your customer (KYC) to all of its gateways would prove rather problematic.Anyone who has done business with more than one bitcoin exchange has dealt with verifying identity documents over and over again. This is an issue that Ripple is working to solve.Greg Kidd, Ripple\'s chief risk officer and a former director at Promontory Financial Group, said:""There’s sort of the balance between security, knowing everything about everybody. And then there’s privacy, knowing nothing about anyone.""The idea Ripple has is to use OpenID connect to be able to allow people to have a digital payments profile. This would give people ownership over their own financial history – and it could potentially be used globally, even for people in countries that don\'t use credit scores.Said Kidd:""It means everybody in the world can have a payment identity. And they own it – that’s the cool thing, not the government, not the bank.""Moving moneySince Ripple wants to be a payment platform, it is courting developers and bitcoin enthusiasts to get involved.Some cryptocurrency investors have realized the potential to move cryptocoins and currencies from one place to another, said Thomas:""Our biggest constituency and the people who get the most value out of the system are bitcoiners trying to move money between different exchanges.""Andrew White, who won a Ripple contest at a developer event for his \'One Million Gateways\' concept, believes his idea is an example of the potential that exists for the protocol to be used to move money much easier than every before:""I believe One Million Gateways will be used for prototyping services by enterprises looking to get into the space.""Services that could use the concept include remittances businesses, currency exchanges and payment processors.Users don\'t necessarily need to know that Ripple is being used as the ""pipe"" but companies could use Ripple to facilitate these types of transactions.Smart ContractsSeveral efforts already exist to implement smart contracts that don\'t require a third party.Ideas like Ethereum and colored coins exist because block chain technology allows for a system of enforcing contracts to protect the average person like never before.The rise of legal technicalities like arbitration clauses have inadvertently taken away rights from consumers to fight contracts in court. However, smart contracts offer more logic and less legal minutiae.Ripple is working on a smart contract enforcement system that will compliment its payment protocol.Said Thomas:""You have to come up with interfaces, between the sandbox where these contracts are running and the rest of the network functionalities.""If smart contracts are to be adopted, they have be trusted. This is something that Thomas has spent over two years thinking about, and the best system that he has found relies on x86 machine code that is very tight, meaning it has no flaws conceptually.Thomas says that Ripple will use Google\'s Native Client, a solution that directly uses hardware-based machine code:""What Native Client does, the sandbox that it uses, it relies on this mathematical model which means that you can verify that it won’t break out of the sandbox.""Native Client could be the best way to enforce a digital contract with low-level control, by using a very small codebase as a ""sandbox"" to protect from any abnormalities that could happen at a higher, web-based level.Focus on protocolThere have been numerous detractors that have dismissed Ripple because it doesn\'t operate like most other cryptocurrencies.But other than bitcoin, litecoin and perhaps dogecoin, most crytpocurrencies aren\'t payment mechanisms anyhow.Ripple\'s focus on developing an open-source core payment protocol is different because there is no central figure directing the course of development. The company currently has eight core protocol developers, and is looking for more.There is also a startup accelerator. CrossCoin Ventures, an independent entity but up two floors from the Ripple HQ, is looking for talent that can leverage the protocol.LibraTax, a company that does virtual currency tax returns, is the first tenet there. The impact of having a protocol prepared for mass adoption is something that developers should not dismiss, according to Larson, the Ripple CEO:""The protocol can just exist. That kind of macro opportunity should not be wasted.""Relying on a community of developers, investors and financial companies is what Ripple is trying to foster. At the same time, focusing on the core technical aspects of its payment protocol is the company\'s real goal.Ripple is hoping that the rest will be taken care of by those who seek an opportunity to change the current system of financial payments and contract enforcement.""That’s the beauty of it,"" said Asheesh Birla, the company\'s head of product. There are a lot of options to be involved with Ripple: Gateway, market maker or app developer leveraging the Ripple API, he said:""You can either do all of it, or you can separate it out and leverage the existing ecosystem.""Featured Image by CoinDeskThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The Bitcoin Price Index as of 9 a.m. on April 10 was $411.13 USD.At this moment, computers around the world are racing to solve complex algorithms. Whoever wins earns the prize of 25 newly created bitcoins. This digital money can then be traded or used to buy goods directly.But running all those math formulas to make this cyber-currency takes a lot of electricity. And that in turn takes us to central Washington. The largest “Bitcoin mine” in North America can be found on the outskirts of Wenatchee, Washington.For the Here & Now Contributors Network, Tom Banse of Northwest News Network paid a visit.ReporterTom Banse is a regional correspondent for Northwest News Network. He tweets @TomBanse.Copyright 2014 WBUR-FM. To see more, visit http://www.wbur.orgTranscriptJEREMY HOBSON, HOST:Well, the alternative currency bitcoin got a bit of a boost this week from the establishment. At an event showcasing a bitcoin ATM on Capitol Hill, Jared Polis, a Democratic congressman from Colorado, became the first member of Congress to buy bitcoin. Polis spent $10 to get .02 btc. He said he was going to buy a pair of socks.Well, despite the endorsement, the price of bitcoin fell about $50 today following announcements from bitcoin exchanges in China that they will be suspending bank transfers. So if you\'re still trying to get your head around bitcoin, I don\'t blame you. It\'s relatively new, and most of us don\'t use it or even know where it comes from.That would be a bitcoin mine, not a mine like we think of traditionally. It\'s a datacenter. The largest bitcoin mine in North America is located on the outskirts of Wenatchee in Washington State. It is two warehouses converted into a datacenter where computers solve complex algorithms to produce the virtual currency.From the HERE AND NOW contributors network, Tom Banse reports.TOM BANSE: OK, so we\'re going to go into what\'s called a mine, but we don\'t have tools or helmets or lamps.DAVE CARLSON: Yeah, there\'s no pickaxes here.BANSE: No, OK.CARLSON: There\'s no danger of cave-in.BANSE: I\'m talking with Dave Carlson. He\'s the CEO of mine operator MegaBigPower. Carlson leads me through the unmarked door of what looks from the outside like a cold-storage warehouse.OK, we can feel the air moving right behind us, big floor fans. The sound you hear behind us.CARLSON: And that\'s all just to try to pull the heat out as best we can from all of this equipment.BANSE: So where are the miners?CARLSON: This is a miner right here. All of these green boards have arrays of computer chips on them. And each computer chip is doing the processing required to make a little bit of bitcoin. As you can see, we have them massively arrayed. There are thousands and thousands of boards here.BANSE: All those digital mining rigs are chipping away at the complex mathematical puzzles cooked up by the still unknown developers of bitcoin. The miners want to win the prize for having the right solution at the right time. Every 10 minutes there are 25 new bitcoins up for grabs.CARLSON: It used to be when we first fired these off, they had some sort of residual oils and things from assembly. And it would burn off, and so, you know, that was the smell of money when we first started firing these things up.BANSE: Both the miners and the global bitcoin community win from this furious number crunching because the act of mining contributes processor power to verify and secure the public ledger of bitcoin transactions. Carlson initially got into bitcoin mining as a hobby in 2012. Since then he\'s witnessed an exponential rise in miners chasing the fixed supply of new bitcoins.CARLSON: And so you\'re in this constant race to sort of beat this virtual competition, of which you don\'t know who these people are, but you can see on the network that this power is being added every single day.BANSE: And that in turn creates more and more electricity demand, which is why Carlson relocated to the land of rock-bottom-cheap hydropower last year. Electricity rates in central Washington State run less than a quarter of the national average. Low power rates are why other industrial bitcoin miners are where they are, places such as Texas, Quebec, Iceland and Sweden.This angle is what attracted a competitor to central Washington to set up a datacenter for individually owned mining rigs. Computer engineer Bernie Rihn of Seattle founded the startup HashPlex.BERNIE RIHN: Many people have these pieces of hardware that draw tens of kilowatts in their house. And their girlfriends aren\'t happy about it, and their wives aren\'t happy about it, and they have to fix it all the time.BANSE: So Rihn\'s new company offers hobbyists and investors a bitcoin mining computer away from home. Rihn cautions that bitcoin needs to win wider acceptance at retail for the mining businesses to grow into a sought-after industry cluster. The value of the unregulated virtual currency has been quite volatile lately. MegaBigPower executive Carlson has tasted the dark side of the alternative currency.

Taigi aš tikrai nesutinku, kad visa tai yra vien neigiama.Žinoma, valiuta buvo naudota ir blogiems dalykams, tačiau turime suprasti, kad valiuta neturi moralės – blogus dalykus daro žmonės, o ne valiutos.– Minėjote, kad Argentinoje bitkoinais laikomos santaupos žmonėms padėjo apsisaugoti nuo infliacijos, o Kipre – netikėtų valdžios sprendimų apmokestinti indėlius. Tačiau ar išties pastovios kainos neturintys bitkoinai, kurių vertė per pusmetį sumažėjo trečdaliu, yra geriausias būdas apsisaugoti?– Trumpuoju laikotarpiu yra išties daug kainų svyravimų. Tačiau ilguoju laikotarpiu Argentinoje kur kas labiau apsimokėjo investuoti į bitkoinus, negu į Argentinos valiutą – pesą. Tie žmonės, kurie perka bitkoinus, žiūri penkis ar dešimt metų į priekį. Be to, į bitkoinus galima investuoti ir dalį savo pinigų.– Ar, jūsų nuomone, yra kitų virtualių valiutų, kurios galėtų nukonkuruoti bitkoinus?– Dabar yra daugiau kaip šimtas kriptovaliutų, tačiau visos jos yra išvestos iš bitkoinų – visos jos paėmė bitkoinų kodą ir kažką jame pakeitė. Yra „dosecoin“, „litecoin“ ir t.t. Tačiau jos nėra tokios patikimos ir saugios. Jos daugiau yra tarsi žaidimai, kitos yra padarytos visiškai juokais, jas yra labai lengva nulaužti.– Daugelyje šalių bitkoinai yra draudžiami. Kaip manote, ar pasikeis vyriausybių požiūris į šią valiutą?– Aš tuo labai abejoju. Tačiau šalys, kurios bitkoinus priims, tikrai išloš. Galvokime apie bitkoinus kaip apie internetinį pokerį, kuris kai kuriose šalyse draudžiamas. Bet tam tikrose šalyse jis leidžiamos ir labai sustiprina ekonomiką – pavyzdžiui, Maltoje. Tas pats bus ir su bitkoinu, jei ši valiuta nėra laukiama vienoje šalyje, ji bus laukiama kitoje. Šalis, kuri atmes bitkoinus, praloš, o bitkoinai vis tiek taps populiarūs kažkur kitur.']"

04/13/2014,"['Forget currencies and commodities … perhaps the most helpful analogy for Bitcoin is \'land\', argues Richard Gendal Brown.Oleg Andreev posted an insightful tweet the other day:Bitcoin is not a protocol of transfer, but a protocol of ownership. Coins never travel, but simply switch owners. — Oleg Andreev (@oleganza) March 20, 2014You could argue this is a trivial observation – ""how else could it work?!"" – but thinking in terms of ownership and protocols for transfer of ownership is a surprisingly helpful way to think about how the system works. That’s because the \'protocol of ownership\' insight means there is a whole other world of history, tradition and precedent to learn from: land.Here are some observations to motivate the thought:In the end-state the quantity of bitcoin will be fixed, just like landBitcoin is not perfectly fungible and neither is landBitcoin is not \'consumed\' through use – just transformed and transferred. This is similar to land and dissimilar to many commodities, which are consumed (or at least degraded) through useOK – not a perfect parallel but let’s go with it for now. What happens if we think about bitcoin through the lens of land?Well, first, it allows us to think about coins that haven’t been mined yet … We can think of them as parcels of land on “Bitcoin Island” that haven’t been released:The “Land Interpretation” of bitcoin. Think “Bitcoin Island”.Second, it helps us put some intuition behind the concept of the \'unspent transaction output\'. These are bitcoins that have been sent somewhere but not yet themselves been spent. So the set of all unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) can be thought of as the latest state of every bitcoin that has ever been mined.The UTXO is absolutely crucial to everything in bitcoin and yet very few people think in these terms, talking instead about misleading terms like “address balances” and so forth.But the interesting thing is: if we take a \'land interpretation\' of bitcoin, then UTXOs have a really simple explanation: they are plots of land! And bitcoin transactions are simply actions that merge or split these plots of land.Imagine I own 20 bitcoins. My bitcoin wallet software will show a \'balance\' of 20. But it’s likely that this balance actually consists of multiple unspent-transaction outputs.Even if I had bought all 20 bitcoins in one go, it’s likely that the seller merged several smaller UTXOs that added up in total to twenty bitcoins. So perhaps I received three plots of \'land\': 7 bitcoins in one, 7 in another and 6 in the third. My total \'holdings\' are 20 – but it is formed from three \'UTXOs\'.Perhaps my holdings on Bitcoin Island look like this:We can think of Unspent Transaction Outputs as plots of land on \'Bitcoin Island\'. Plots A, B, C represent three unspent transaction outputs controlling 20 bitcoins.And now it’s possible to teach people about bitcoin transactions without completely confusing them!Imagine I wanted to buy a second-hand car for 11 of my bitcoins. Let’s also imagine that I pay a transaction fee of 1 BTC to keep things simple (a HUGE over-estimate, of course).I need to do a few things:Step One : I need to prove ownership of the coins I’m trying to spend: I need to prove ownership of the coins I’m trying to spend Step Two : I need to say how the coins are going to be allocated – how many am I sending and to where? 11 to the seller, 8 back to me and 1 for the miner in this case: I need to say how the coins are going to be allocated – how many am I sending and to where? 11 to the seller, 8 back to me and 1 for the miner in this case Step Three: I need to specify what the new “owners” will need to do to prove they do indeed own the coins. In other words, I need to specify what they will need to do in their Step one when they try to spend their coins in the futureI do this in bitcoin by issuing a transaction that accomplishes all three steps in one. Here’s what it might say:“I own three unspent transaction outputs: A, B and C. In total they represent twenty bitcoins. Here is my proof I am entitled to spend A. Here is my proof I am entitled to spend B. Here is my proof I am entitled to spend C. I hereby reshape my plot into two new plots: one plot 8 units in size, which I call X and a second plot 11 units in size, which I call Y. Whoever mines this transaction can claim the remaining 1 BTC. If you can satisfy the following conditions then you will be considered to own X: … . If you can satisfy the following conditions then you will be considered to own Y: …”I will set the conditions so that only the seller of the car could satisfy the Y condition and so that only I could satisfy the X condition (that’s my change and I don’t want anybody else spending it!).The end result is that I have simply rearranged the land holdings:Transaction outputs A, B, C are now spent, replaced by two new unspent transaction outputs: X and Y. X is my change, Y now belongs to the car dealer and F goes to the miner.But we can go further … we can now have an informed discussion about what “ownership” means in bitcoin. When I “send” bitcoins to somebody, I’m not assigning ownership to an individual. What I’m actually doing is laying down a condition – and anybody who can satisfy that condition will be considered the owner.Now, normally, the condition is very simple. It says something like:“To spend this output you must prove you know the public key that hashes to the following address: … And you must prove you own the corresponding private key by issuing a digital signature”.That’s what the “OP_DUP OP_HASH160 …” stuff you sometimes see is usually saying.But the conditions can be far more complex than that … It’s all down to how you write your transaction.Where is this going?OK – so thinking of bitcoin in terms of land helps us build some intuition around UTXOs, which we can think of as \'parcels of land on Bitcoin Island\' and we see that bitcoin transactions are really just a way to merge or split these parcels of land and impose conditions that allow people to assert ownership.And now things get really interesting. Because there are all sorts of interesting phenomena that happen with land transactions that we can use to think about bitcoin problems.FungibilityThe land analogy works because bitcoins are not perfectly fungible. Sure – there are projects trying to overcome this but this feels like an arms race between developers and law-enforcement agencies. To the extent that fungibility remains imperfect, what drivers could force different \'land parcels\' to have different values?For me, the biggest topic on the horizon for fungibility is \'coin tainting\', \'whitelisting\' and the other schemes intended to \'tag\' bitcoin addresses or UTXOs.I see these schemes as directly analogous to concepts like land \'blight\' on the one hand and maybe \'planning gain\' on the other. For example, if you own a \'plot of Bitcoin land\' that has been \'whitelisted\' by an exchange or finance firm such that you can access their services, presumably your \'plot\' would be worth more than one that didn’t have that property?It is perhaps no surprise that the fungibility issue is so hot right now.Mineral Rights and Colored CoinsTwo pieces of seemingly identical land can be worth vastly different sums: if one is sitting on oil and the owner has mineral rights, a purchaser will be willing to pay them more for their land than if it didn’t!Perhaps this is a useful analogy for colored coins: two identical bitcoins can trade for different prices if one of them has been \'colored\' by a trusted issuer. What are the taxation implications? What happens when projects trying to add coin coloration to bitcoin conflict with projects trying to create fungibility?AltcoinsPerhaps Altcoins are just different islands! If there is a Bitcoin Island, then presumably Litecoin has Litecoin Island and Dogecoin has Dogecoin Island?This interpretation now helps us think more clearly about the role and value of altcoins. Perhaps the innate characteristic of a currency (faster confirmation time? Use of scrypt?) makes the island a more attractive place to live. But if all the infrastructure and population is on Bitcoin Island then these features may not be enough – who knows.Charges and LiensIt is possible to impose conditions on land parcels in many jurisdictions. A mortgage company can prevent sale of land unless the debt is settled and some landowners in the UK have been dismayed to discover that their land ownership came with an expensive obligation to pay for the upkeep of a local church.In some cases, the obligation is short-lived (eg the mortgage charge) but in others, it persists across transactions (eg chancel repair liability). A question I don’t know the answer to is: can you write a bitcoin transaction that imposes conditions on a UTXO that propagate? That is: can you write a transaction such that whoever spends the UTXO must impose the same condition on their transaction output?ConclusionOf course, the land analogy is imperfect but I do think there is something to it. If nothing else, the mental image of \'Bitcoin Island\' with UTXOs being the plots of land feels like a really useful one. It has certainly helped my understanding.Richard Gendal Brown writes on bitcoin and other trends in finance here, his views do not necessarily represent those of IBM.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Bitcoin Vigil is a project aiming to give users a new way to detect malware on their personal computers, offering a method of intrusion detection that tracks malware attempting to steal bitcoins from PC wallets.Eric Springer, a Canadian developer living in Mexico, thinks Bitcoin Vigil\'s idea is pretty simple:""You can just leave the bitcoin wallet on your computer, and it will let you know if you have malware.""How it worksWhen users fund a wallet on the Bitcoin Vigil website, they can download a database file containing the wallet\'s information. It is effectively a wallet generated with bitcoins that is unencrypted to make it as easy on malware as possible, Springer explained.With the rise of cryptocurrency-stealing libraries being dropped into malware, Bitcoin Vigil acts as what it calls a ""money pot"" – a carrot that malicious software commonly looks for on infected computers.If the key is used to move the small amount of bitcoins, Bitcoin Vigil notifies the user by email, with an additional option for an SMS notification.Springer says that malware creators have no qualms about looking for bitcoin like low hanging fruit:""I don’t think anyone’s going in specifically targeting bitcoin as their only purpose [for malware], I just don’t think that they have any ethical concerns stealing whatever they find.""Malware going after bitcoinDell SecureWorks recently released a report that identified almost 150 strains of what it calls cryptocurrency stealing malware (CCSM), up from 45 a year prior.The reason for the surge is simple: decentralized money is becoming popular, and that means it is a valuable thing to take from unsuspecting users.Joe Stewart, one of the authors of the SecureWorks report, recently tweeted about Springer\'s service:Looks like the Bitcoin-wallet-as-host-IDS idea I tweeted on Nov 21 last year is actually a service now: http://t.co/sbUdVbug7x — Joe Stewart (@joestewart71) April 10, 2014IDS stands for intrusion detection system, which is Bitcoin Vigil\'s role in monitoring the wallet addresses.According to SecureWorks, the most common type of CCSM is known as the ""wallet stealer."" It looks for files in common locations that are similar to ""wallet.dat"" – the same type of file that Bitcoin Vigil uses.And if the money is moved from the wallet, Bitcoin Vigil\'s system sees it, said Springer.""Whenever it notices a transaction it just looks at all the inputs. And if it comes from one of the wallets I generated I just send an SMS and email out.""Cryptocurrencies as IT securitySpringer said he decided to create the service to detect wallet file theft after realizing one didn\'t exist. ""After losing some bitcoins, it seemed like a logical idea,"" he said.Though he concedes to the fact that most people don\'t keep wallets stored on their computers, he believes that many who are at risk of losing important information on an insecure system unknowingly infected with malware could use Bitcoin Vigil.Another problem, he said, is that people need bitcoins in order to make this method work, which means it might be more suited for larger systems, versus individual PCs:""The limiting factor is that you actually have to put money in each of the wallets.""Despite these challenges, Bitcoin Vigil again proves that cryptocurrencies can be used as an IT security tool. Recently, crowdsourced IT security startup CrowdCurity launched its \'Capture the Coin\' contest, placing bitcoin private keys on its site to see if participants could find them.""You need to be on a computer that doesn’t have bitcoin-stealing malware,"" said Springer, and the growing popularity of decentralized money means that malware creators are on the hunt for private keys.Ideas like Bitcoin Vigil are ways to detect system intrusions proactively rather than running scans reactively when something appears to be wrong.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But in terms of the long-term prospects of cryptocurrencies – and those who are investing time and money on the expectation that the technology itself will prosper – this is no bad thing.It is now generally accepted, because both the FT and the Economist say so, that China has been the dominant force in driving bitcoin prices up. More than half the bitcoin action in the world has been sucked into the Middle Kingdom, and not because everyone there wants to buy alpaca socks or skinny lattes.Instead, the suction has been driven by the osmotic fiscal pressure of having a ferocious economy and a fiat currency badly in need of revaluation.Bitcoin looked very good as an alternative tradable investment device. Too good, decided the Mandarins, who have allegedly re-established the protective veil around the renminbi by banning bitcoin-to-fiat trading.If true, this would have two effects: one being a little obvious round about now. If bitcoin is to be an investment vehicle, it’ll have to be one without the Chinese involved. Where will the value end up? Well, using the highly scientific method of looking at the price over the past year, John Law reckons around $180 to $230, which is where it was happily sitting for a while before some massive object started to pull it skywards. Eastwards, if you prefer.The other is that there will be a huge pool of bitcoin sitting in China that can’t be cashed in. But they will still be moved around – like currency’s supposed to do – and they will retain their nominal value as set by the rest of the world. They’ll still have value, but only if they’re used to buy stuff.An industrious and hard-working nation like China will make use of that. Alpaca socks and skinny lattes are unlikely to see much of a surge, but you can bet your bottom yuan that deals for goods and services will be struck and bitcoin will circulate. Which means its true value, as a damn fine mechanism for circulating, will be realised – alongside all the ancillary economic activity in support services and products.Which is good news for those investing in such things. When faced with broken china, get cracking.MintChip takes a lickingMintChip sounds delicious, like the sort of ice cream John Law remembers – along with sunburn and sand in his socks – from childhood summer holidays. But the ice creams of yesteryear have long since melted and MintChip, a Canadian government initiative in electronic currency announced in 2012, is going the same way.The Canadian state is trying to wash its hands of the sticky residue, hoping that a private company will take it over, but enthusiasm is as limp as a Magnum left in a glove compartment for five hours on the hottest day of the year. (Don’t ask – thank God it was a rental.)But why has it failed, you cry. How can a government project, run by a government agency, tied to the existing government currency, based on a physical chip, limited to one country and relying on governmental software, not have generated the excitement of bitcoin?It’s hard to credit. But check out this Q&A with MintChip project boss Marc Brûlé – who sounds like he’s named after a posh pudding himself – as he went on a 2013 promotional press circus. The idea was cooked up at a retreat of the Royal Canadian Mint executives, where they decided what consumers wanted from electronic currency. They’re a diversified business. They’re good at patents, too.To be fair, MintChip did get some things right – peer-to-peer transfers, low overhead, usable just as physical currency online and in real life. Real advantages, and key features any electronic currency will need to succeed.So why has bitcoin been so successful that governments are trying to ban it while government and big business projects sink out of the bottom of the cone like a melted 99? Remember Visa Cash? Mondex?It’s called letting go. What the Internet knows, and what big pre-Internet concerns do not, is that unless you are a certifiable genius, trying to guess what people want is a really bad way of giving it to them. Hollywood, as William Goldman said, is a place where nobody knows anything. Turns out that that’s true of most things. People are ungrateful sots who persist on deciding for themselves what they like. The best way to make that work for an idea is to put it out there and see what use is made of it – and to make sure that anyone can say “Hm, yes… but what if we try it this way?”.Before the Internet, the closest most businesses got to that was focus groups and pilot projects – or just spending enough on marketing to persuade people that they did want something they wouldn’t otherwise look twice at. Or going on a retreat with your pals and pretending to be certifiable geniuses. That way, you get cash-onna-dongle.What bitcoin and chums have that the Royal Canadian Mint does not isn’t some sort of philosophical purity or magic, God-given genius. It has reddit, Github, blogs and open code.And that can’t be licked.Architecture and MoralityJohn Law is easily puzzled, but the equation of bitcoin mining with immorality really has him beat. How can it be moral, the argument goes, to burn all those planet – endangering megawatts in the chase for something so ephemeral and tainted with greed?As Coindesk’s own Danny Bradbury is so eloquently exploring, if you take that tack you better be prepared to look at the same equations for the rest of the financial system. It’s also worth casting a look at, oh, gold mining, which chomps through so much power that even at the current exalted price for the metal it’s actually becoming uneconomic. And that gouges actual holes in the planet.But perhaps the critics have a point. After all, every action does have a moral component, and we are comprehensively mucking the environment right up. People don’t want to be evil, but it is impossible to know whether plonking down on the sofa to watch Game of Thrones on a 40” plasma is more culpable in the pleasure-vs-guilt scale of things than driving into town to buy the books. And what if you order them online? More to the point, can bitcoin actually be an unarguable force for moral good?John Law has a modest proposal. Alongside the Internet of Things, where all our devices talk to each other about what they’re doing, we must create the Internet of Sins, where they talk about us.Like any useful technology, the IoS takes something that humans need to do but are bad at doing, and offers the services of automation to relieve us of the burden. Think of it like carbon offsetting but with micropayments and – crucially – a central exchange of naughtiness that sets a value on the good-to-evil scale for everything. It will be a bitcoin of cosmic responsibility: the karmacoin.All our interactions with technology are metered and stored, these days, and just about everything we do is an interaction with technology. Your TV knows what you’re watching and how much power you’re using, while the shop that sells you your TV set knows who made it and how it got there. In turn, the acts of manufacturing and transportation are documented in detail by the computer systems that manage them. The oil that goes into the plastic, the metals that go into the circuitry, the investments in education or armaments that the bank that finances the TV makers has, everything can be factored in.The architecture of the Internet of Sins is conceptually simple. Each such interaction can be graded on the good-versus-evil scale and the value stored, to be transferred along the chain. You’ll end up with your share in your karma wallet whenever you take an action, all transferred by the same anonymous-yet-unfakeable protocols that power cryptocurrencies. The good-versus-evil index will be created by a global database of acts graded by mass consensus – a computerised version of how we decide our morals anyway. The flame wars in the comments will be epic.What we do with our accumulation of karmacoins will, in the end, be up to us. But at least we’ll truly know the consequences of our actions.Bet it won’t just be the Chinese that ban that.John Law is an 18th Century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler.

The social network is only weeks away from obtaining regulatory approval in Ireland for a service that would allow its users to store money on Facebook and use it to pay and exchange money with others, according to several people involved in the process. The authorisation from Ireland’s central bank to become an “e-money” institution would allow Facebook to issue units of stored monetary value that represent a claim against the company. This e-money would be valid throughout Europe via a process known as “passporting”. Facebook has also discussed potential partnerships with at least three London start-ups that offer international money transfer services online and via smartphones: TransferWise, Moni Technologies and Azimo, according to three people involved in the discussions. In the case of Azimo, Facebook offered to pay the company $10m to recruit one of its co-founders as a director of business development, according to people familiar with the situation. A Facebook spokesperson said the company did not comment on “rumour and speculation”. London’s financial technology sector has thrived thanks to the high concentration of financial services companies, a congenial timezone for international transactions and a more unified regulatory environment in Europe compared with the US. A foray into migrant remittances is part of Facebook’s push to increase its presence in emerging markets. “Facebook wants to become a utility in the developing world, and remittances are a gateway drug to financial inclusion,” said a person familiar with the company’s strategy. Facebook recently passed 100m users in India, which is its largest national market outside the United States. But it is unclear that people will trust Facebook to handle their money, given concerns about personal data mining by the social media network to boost advertising on the site. Facebook wants to become a utility in the developing world, and remittances are a gateway drug to financial inclusion The money transfer project, led by Sean Ryan, Facebook’s vice-president of platform partnerships, signals a strategic shift for the company, which makes most of its money from advertising. It also comes as other internet groups – in particular, China’s Tencent and Alibaba – race to turn their sites into mobile payment platforms. Google has reiterated its commitment to expanding its mobile payments and wallet products, which have yet to be widely adopted by consumers. It is registered in the UK to issue electronic money, in a process similar to the authorisation which Facebook is seeking in Ireland. Obtaining an e-money authorisation in Ireland would require Facebook to hold capital of €350,000 and segregate funds equivalent to the amount of money it has issued, according to legal experts. FT Video Facebook’s land grab for customers February 2014: Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp puts it at the heart of the communications world with an application that already has 450m users. Daniel Thomas, FT telecoms correspondent, says the deal shows Facebook wants to own the mobile phone home screen Facebook is already authorised for some forms of money transfer in the United States, allowing it to process payments for developers who charge users for in-app purchases. In 2013, the company facilitated $2.1bn worth of transactions, almost exclusively from games, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Facebook takes a fee of up to 30 per cent for such payments, and these fees account for about 10 per cent of its revenues. Vodafone has acquired an e-money licence for the phone company to operate financial services in Europe. “It’s great news that non-banks are challenging the traditional banking monopoly,” said Simon Deane-Johns, a UK-based lawyer and European payments expert at law firm Keystone Law.

So perhaps I received three plots of \'land\': 7 bitcoins in one, 7 in another and 6 in the third. My total \'holdings\' are 20 – but it is formed from three \'UTXOs\'.Perhaps my holdings on Bitcoin Island look like this:We can think of Unspent Transaction Outputs as plots of land on \'Bitcoin Island\'. Plots A, B, C represent three unspent transaction outputs controlling 20 bitcoins.And now it’s possible to teach people about bitcoin transactions without completely confusing them!Imagine I wanted to buy a second-hand car for 11 of my bitcoins. Let’s also imagine that I pay a transaction fee of 1 BTC to keep things simple (a HUGE over-estimate, of course).I need to do a few things:Step One : I need to prove ownership of the coins I’m trying to spend: I need to prove ownership of the coins I’m trying to spend Step Two : I need to say how the coins are going to be allocated – how many am I sending and to where? 11 to the seller, 8 back to me and 1 for the miner in this case: I need to say how the coins are going to be allocated – how many am I sending and to where? 11 to the seller, 8 back to me and 1 for the miner in this case Step Three: I need to specify what the new “owners” will need to do to prove they do indeed own the coins. In other words, I need to specify what they will need to do in their Step one when they try to spend their coins in the futureI do this in bitcoin by issuing a transaction that accomplishes all three steps in one. Here’s what it might say:“I own three unspent transaction outputs: A, B and C. In total they represent twenty bitcoins. Here is my proof I am entitled to spend A. Here is my proof I am entitled to spend B. Here is my proof I am entitled to spend C. I hereby reshape my plot into two new plots: one plot 8 units in size, which I call X and a second plot 11 units in size, which I call Y. Whoever mines this transaction can claim the remaining 1 BTC. If you can satisfy the following conditions then you will be considered to own X: … . If you can satisfy the following conditions then you will be considered to own Y: …”I will set the conditions so that only the seller of the car could satisfy the Y condition and so that only I could satisfy the X condition (that’s my change and I don’t want anybody else spending it!).The end result is that I have simply rearranged the land holdings:Transaction outputs A, B, C are now spent, replaced by two new unspent transaction outputs: X and Y. X is my change, Y now belongs to the car dealer and F goes to the miner.But we can go further … we can now have an informed discussion about what “ownership” means in bitcoin. When I “send” bitcoins to somebody, I’m not assigning ownership to an individual. What I’m actually doing is laying down a condition – and anybody who can satisfy that condition will be considered the owner.Now, normally, the condition is very simple. It says something like:“To spend this output you must prove you know the public key that hashes to the following address: … And you must prove you own the corresponding private key by issuing a digital signature”.That’s what the “OP_DUP OP_HASH160 …” stuff you sometimes see is usually saying.But the conditions can be far more complex than that … It’s all down to how you write your transaction.Where is this going?OK – so thinking of bitcoin in terms of land helps us build some intuition around UTXOs, which we can think of as \'parcels of land on Bitcoin Island\' and we see that bitcoin transactions are really just a way to merge or split these parcels of land and impose conditions that allow people to assert ownership.And now things get really interesting. Because there are all sorts of interesting phenomena that happen with land transactions that we can use to think about bitcoin problems.FungibilityThe land analogy works because bitcoins are not perfectly fungible. Sure – there are projects trying to overcome this but this feels like an arms race between developers and law-enforcement agencies. To the extent that fungibility remains imperfect, what drivers could force different \'land parcels\' to have different values?For me, the biggest topic on the horizon for fungibility is \'coin tainting\', \'whitelisting\' and the other schemes intended to \'tag\' bitcoin addresses or UTXOs.I see these schemes as directly analogous to concepts like land \'blight\' on the one hand and maybe \'planning gain\' on the other. For example, if you own a \'plot of Bitcoin land\' that has been \'whitelisted\' by an exchange or finance firm such that you can access their services, presumably your \'plot\' would be worth more than one that didn’t have that property?It is perhaps no surprise that the fungibility issue is so hot right now.Mineral Rights and Colored CoinsTwo pieces of seemingly identical land can be worth vastly different sums: if one is sitting on oil and the owner has mineral rights, a purchaser will be willing to pay them more for their land than if it didn’t!Perhaps this is a useful analogy for colored coins: two identical bitcoins can trade for different prices if one of them has been \'colored\' by a trusted issuer. What are the taxation implications? What happens when projects trying to add coin coloration to bitcoin conflict with projects trying to create fungibility?AltcoinsPerhaps Altcoins are just different islands! If there is a Bitcoin Island, then presumably Litecoin has Litecoin Island and Dogecoin has Dogecoin Island?This interpretation now helps us think more clearly about the role and value of altcoins. Perhaps the innate characteristic of a currency (faster confirmation time? Use of scrypt?) makes the island a more attractive place to live. But if all the infrastructure and population is on Bitcoin Island then these features may not be enough – who knows.Charges and LiensIt is possible to impose conditions on land parcels in many jurisdictions. A mortgage company can prevent sale of land unless the debt is settled and some landowners in the UK have been dismayed to discover that their land ownership came with an expensive obligation to pay for the upkeep of a local church.In some cases, the obligation is short-lived (eg the mortgage charge) but in others, it persists across transactions (eg chancel repair liability). A question I don’t know the answer to is: can you write a bitcoin transaction that imposes conditions on a UTXO that propagate? That is: can you write a transaction such that whoever spends the UTXO must impose the same condition on their transaction output?ConclusionOf course, the land analogy is imperfect but I do think there is something to it. If nothing else, the mental image of \'Bitcoin Island\' with UTXOs being the plots of land feels like a really useful one. It has certainly helped my understanding.Richard Gendal Brown writes on bitcoin and other trends in finance here, his views do not necessarily represent those of IBM.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Bitcoin Vigil is a project aiming to give users a new way to detect malware on their personal computers, offering a method of intrusion detection that tracks malware attempting to steal bitcoins from PC wallets.Eric Springer, a Canadian developer living in Mexico, thinks Bitcoin Vigil\'s idea is pretty simple:""You can just leave the bitcoin wallet on your computer, and it will let you know if you have malware.""How it worksWhen users fund a wallet on the Bitcoin Vigil website, they can download a database file containing the wallet\'s information. It is effectively a wallet generated with bitcoins that is unencrypted to make it as easy on malware as possible, Springer explained.With the rise of cryptocurrency-stealing libraries being dropped into malware, Bitcoin Vigil acts as what it calls a ""money pot"" – a carrot that malicious software commonly looks for on infected computers.If the key is used to move the small amount of bitcoins, Bitcoin Vigil notifies the user by email, with an additional option for an SMS notification.Springer says that malware creators have no qualms about looking for bitcoin like low hanging fruit:""I don’t think anyone’s going in specifically targeting bitcoin as their only purpose [for malware], I just don’t think that they have any ethical concerns stealing whatever they find.""Malware going after bitcoinDell SecureWorks recently released a report that identified almost 150 strains of what it calls cryptocurrency stealing malware (CCSM), up from 45 a year prior.The reason for the surge is simple: decentralized money is becoming popular, and that means it is a valuable thing to take from unsuspecting users.Joe Stewart, one of the authors of the SecureWorks report, recently tweeted about Springer\'s service:Looks like the Bitcoin-wallet-as-host-IDS idea I tweeted on Nov 21 last year is actually a service now: http://t.co/sbUdVbug7x — Joe Stewart (@joestewart71) April 10, 2014IDS stands for intrusion detection system, which is Bitcoin Vigil\'s role in monitoring the wallet addresses.According to SecureWorks, the most common type of CCSM is known as the ""wallet stealer."" It looks for files in common locations that are similar to ""wallet.dat"" – the same type of file that Bitcoin Vigil uses.And if the money is moved from the wallet, Bitcoin Vigil\'s system sees it, said Springer.""Whenever it notices a transaction it just looks at all the inputs. And if it comes from one of the wallets I generated I just send an SMS and email out.""Cryptocurrencies as IT securitySpringer said he decided to create the service to detect wallet file theft after realizing one didn\'t exist. ""After losing some bitcoins, it seemed like a logical idea,"" he said.Though he concedes to the fact that most people don\'t keep wallets stored on their computers, he believes that many who are at risk of losing important information on an insecure system unknowingly infected with malware could use Bitcoin Vigil.Another problem, he said, is that people need bitcoins in order to make this method work, which means it might be more suited for larger systems, versus individual PCs:""The limiting factor is that you actually have to put money in each of the wallets.""Despite these challenges, Bitcoin Vigil again proves that cryptocurrencies can be used as an IT security tool. Recently, crowdsourced IT security startup CrowdCurity launched its \'Capture the Coin\' contest, placing bitcoin private keys on its site to see if participants could find them.""You need to be on a computer that doesn’t have bitcoin-stealing malware,"" said Springer, and the growing popularity of decentralized money means that malware creators are on the hunt for private keys.Ideas like Bitcoin Vigil are ways to detect system intrusions proactively rather than running scans reactively when something appears to be wrong.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitcoin-systemet setter begrensninger på hvor mange Bitcoins som kan utvinnes slik at det ikke blir inflasjon i systemet.Profitten fallerTidligere har det vært vanlig for Bitcoin-miners å tjene rundt 25,2 millioner i uken til sammen. Nå er imidlertid de samlede lønningene for Bitcoin-miners 14,9 millioner dollar i uken, eller om lag 89,4 millioner kroner, skriver Bloomberg.- Du er heldig om du får noen profitt i det hele tatt nå for tiden, sier tidligere Bitcoin-utvinner Mehmet Vatansever til Bloomberg.Han regner at han har tapt om lag 6000 dollar, eller 36.000 kroner på å bli Bitoin-utvinner.Store selskaperForrige måned var det rundt 16.000 Bitcoin-maskiner til salgs på Ebay.

But in terms of the long-term prospects of cryptocurrencies – and those who are investing time and money on the expectation that the technology itself will prosper – this is no bad thing.It is now generally accepted, because both the FT and the Economist say so, that China has been the dominant force in driving bitcoin prices up. More than half the bitcoin action in the world has been sucked into the Middle Kingdom, and not because everyone there wants to buy alpaca socks or skinny lattes.Instead, the suction has been driven by the osmotic fiscal pressure of having a ferocious economy and a fiat currency badly in need of revaluation.Bitcoin looked very good as an alternative tradable investment device. Too good, decided the Mandarins, who have allegedly re-established the protective veil around the renminbi by banning bitcoin-to-fiat trading.If true, this would have two effects: one being a little obvious round about now. If bitcoin is to be an investment vehicle, it’ll have to be one without the Chinese involved. Where will the value end up? Well, using the highly scientific method of looking at the price over the past year, John Law reckons around $180 to $230, which is where it was happily sitting for a while before some massive object started to pull it skywards. Eastwards, if you prefer.The other is that there will be a huge pool of bitcoin sitting in China that can’t be cashed in. But they will still be moved around – like currency’s supposed to do – and they will retain their nominal value as set by the rest of the world. They’ll still have value, but only if they’re used to buy stuff.An industrious and hard-working nation like China will make use of that. Alpaca socks and skinny lattes are unlikely to see much of a surge, but you can bet your bottom yuan that deals for goods and services will be struck and bitcoin will circulate. Which means its true value, as a damn fine mechanism for circulating, will be realised – alongside all the ancillary economic activity in support services and products.Which is good news for those investing in such things. When faced with broken china, get cracking.MintChip takes a lickingMintChip sounds delicious, like the sort of ice cream John Law remembers – along with sunburn and sand in his socks – from childhood summer holidays. But the ice creams of yesteryear have long since melted and MintChip, a Canadian government initiative in electronic currency announced in 2012, is going the same way.The Canadian state is trying to wash its hands of the sticky residue, hoping that a private company will take it over, but enthusiasm is as limp as a Magnum left in a glove compartment for five hours on the hottest day of the year. (Don’t ask – thank God it was a rental.)But why has it failed, you cry. How can a government project, run by a government agency, tied to the existing government currency, based on a physical chip, limited to one country and relying on governmental software, not have generated the excitement of bitcoin?It’s hard to credit. But check out this Q&A with MintChip project boss Marc Brûlé – who sounds like he’s named after a posh pudding himself – as he went on a 2013 promotional press circus. The idea was cooked up at a retreat of the Royal Canadian Mint executives, where they decided what consumers wanted from electronic currency. They’re a diversified business. They’re good at patents, too.To be fair, MintChip did get some things right – peer-to-peer transfers, low overhead, usable just as physical currency online and in real life. Real advantages, and key features any electronic currency will need to succeed.So why has bitcoin been so successful that governments are trying to ban it while government and big business projects sink out of the bottom of the cone like a melted 99? Remember Visa Cash? Mondex?It’s called letting go. What the Internet knows, and what big pre-Internet concerns do not, is that unless you are a certifiable genius, trying to guess what people want is a really bad way of giving it to them. Hollywood, as William Goldman said, is a place where nobody knows anything. Turns out that that’s true of most things. People are ungrateful sots who persist on deciding for themselves what they like. The best way to make that work for an idea is to put it out there and see what use is made of it – and to make sure that anyone can say “Hm, yes… but what if we try it this way?”.Before the Internet, the closest most businesses got to that was focus groups and pilot projects – or just spending enough on marketing to persuade people that they did want something they wouldn’t otherwise look twice at. Or going on a retreat with your pals and pretending to be certifiable geniuses. That way, you get cash-onna-dongle.What bitcoin and chums have that the Royal Canadian Mint does not isn’t some sort of philosophical purity or magic, God-given genius. It has reddit, Github, blogs and open code.And that can’t be licked.Architecture and MoralityJohn Law is easily puzzled, but the equation of bitcoin mining with immorality really has him beat. How can it be moral, the argument goes, to burn all those planet – endangering megawatts in the chase for something so ephemeral and tainted with greed?As Coindesk’s own Danny Bradbury is so eloquently exploring, if you take that tack you better be prepared to look at the same equations for the rest of the financial system. It’s also worth casting a look at, oh, gold mining, which chomps through so much power that even at the current exalted price for the metal it’s actually becoming uneconomic. And that gouges actual holes in the planet.But perhaps the critics have a point. After all, every action does have a moral component, and we are comprehensively mucking the environment right up. People don’t want to be evil, but it is impossible to know whether plonking down on the sofa to watch Game of Thrones on a 40” plasma is more culpable in the pleasure-vs-guilt scale of things than driving into town to buy the books. And what if you order them online? More to the point, can bitcoin actually be an unarguable force for moral good?John Law has a modest proposal. Alongside the Internet of Things, where all our devices talk to each other about what they’re doing, we must create the Internet of Sins, where they talk about us.Like any useful technology, the IoS takes something that humans need to do but are bad at doing, and offers the services of automation to relieve us of the burden. Think of it like carbon offsetting but with micropayments and – crucially – a central exchange of naughtiness that sets a value on the good-to-evil scale for everything. It will be a bitcoin of cosmic responsibility: the karmacoin.All our interactions with technology are metered and stored, these days, and just about everything we do is an interaction with technology. Your TV knows what you’re watching and how much power you’re using, while the shop that sells you your TV set knows who made it and how it got there. In turn, the acts of manufacturing and transportation are documented in detail by the computer systems that manage them. The oil that goes into the plastic, the metals that go into the circuitry, the investments in education or armaments that the bank that finances the TV makers has, everything can be factored in.The architecture of the Internet of Sins is conceptually simple. Each such interaction can be graded on the good-versus-evil scale and the value stored, to be transferred along the chain. You’ll end up with your share in your karma wallet whenever you take an action, all transferred by the same anonymous-yet-unfakeable protocols that power cryptocurrencies. The good-versus-evil index will be created by a global database of acts graded by mass consensus – a computerised version of how we decide our morals anyway. The flame wars in the comments will be epic.What we do with our accumulation of karmacoins will, in the end, be up to us. But at least we’ll truly know the consequences of our actions.Bet it won’t just be the Chinese that ban that.John Law is an 18th Century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler.

The social network is only weeks away from obtaining regulatory approval in Ireland for a service that would allow its users to store money on Facebook and use it to pay and exchange money with others, according to several people involved in the process. The authorisation from Ireland’s central bank to become an “e-money” institution would allow Facebook to issue units of stored monetary value that represent a claim against the company. This e-money would be valid throughout Europe via a process known as “passporting”. Facebook has also discussed potential partnerships with at least three London start-ups that offer international money transfer services online and via smartphones: TransferWise, Moni Technologies and Azimo, according to three people involved in the discussions. In the case of Azimo, Facebook offered to pay the company $10m to recruit one of its co-founders as a director of business development, according to people familiar with the situation. A Facebook spokesperson said the company did not comment on “rumour and speculation”. London’s financial technology sector has thrived thanks to the high concentration of financial services companies, a congenial timezone for international transactions and a more unified regulatory environment in Europe compared with the US. A foray into migrant remittances is part of Facebook’s push to increase its presence in emerging markets. “Facebook wants to become a utility in the developing world, and remittances are a gateway drug to financial inclusion,” said a person familiar with the company’s strategy. Facebook recently passed 100m users in India, which is its largest national market outside the United States. But it is unclear that people will trust Facebook to handle their money, given concerns about personal data mining by the social media network to boost advertising on the site. Facebook wants to become a utility in the developing world, and remittances are a gateway drug to financial inclusion The money transfer project, led by Sean Ryan, Facebook’s vice-president of platform partnerships, signals a strategic shift for the company, which makes most of its money from advertising. It also comes as other internet groups – in particular, China’s Tencent and Alibaba – race to turn their sites into mobile payment platforms. Google has reiterated its commitment to expanding its mobile payments and wallet products, which have yet to be widely adopted by consumers. It is registered in the UK to issue electronic money, in a process similar to the authorisation which Facebook is seeking in Ireland. Obtaining an e-money authorisation in Ireland would require Facebook to hold capital of €350,000 and segregate funds equivalent to the amount of money it has issued, according to legal experts. FT Video Facebook’s land grab for customers February 2014: Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp puts it at the heart of the communications world with an application that already has 450m users. Daniel Thomas, FT telecoms correspondent, says the deal shows Facebook wants to own the mobile phone home screen Facebook is already authorised for some forms of money transfer in the United States, allowing it to process payments for developers who charge users for in-app purchases. In 2013, the company facilitated $2.1bn worth of transactions, almost exclusively from games, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Facebook takes a fee of up to 30 per cent for such payments, and these fees account for about 10 per cent of its revenues. Vodafone has acquired an e-money licence for the phone company to operate financial services in Europe. “It’s great news that non-banks are challenging the traditional banking monopoly,” said Simon Deane-Johns, a UK-based lawyer and European payments expert at law firm Keystone Law.

A feeling of invincibility permeated the Road and all who walked it. If the cops hadn’t shut her down yet—after all the media attention the black market had received—then they might never come. This party didn’t have to end.Tony76, an unbelievably successful new dealer, was about to take his crisp Canadian highs worldwide in a grand 4/20 sale that would bring in thousands of customers from across the planet.A new spring had sprung in drug culture, it seemed. On the Silk Road, the possibilities felt endless.“I don’t think I’m risking much,” one anonymous Silk Road vendor wrote on reddit in 2012. “It would be almost impossible for law enforcement to find me… Also, they wouldn’t suspect me. My criminal record is perfectly clean. Not even a parking misdemeanor… I doubt that I could be caught.”A Silk Road arrest? Yeah, right.A pril 20 has been the weed-smoker’s holiday for decades, ever since a gang of California stoners marked the early afternoon time as their designated smoking hour. And now, as more and more dealers have migrated their businesses to the anonymous oases of online black markets, 4/20 has become Black Friday for the Deep Web.With this year’s 4/20 just around the corner, the Deep Web gleams with cheap drugs. A box of 50 edible pot treats costs just $210 over on Cloud Nine market. Girl scout cookies and hash oil are easy to grab as well.Cannabis Road, a marijuana-only black market trying to establish itself as a major player, is holding raffles, with an ounce of any strain of pot the winner chooses as a prize. And Agora marketplace treats weed buyers with free doses of 2C-B, a synthetic bit of insanity that moved from medical use as an aphrodisiac to recreational use as an MDMA substitute in the 1970s and ’80s.Pot isn’t the only hot product on 4/20. AllChem, a group of dealers on Agora, have used the holiday to push their LSD prices way down.“Cheap like borsch, strong like bull,” they say. One hundred hits for $450 and 50 hits for $260 is the perfect amount to begin selling the drug yourself. These sorts of bulk deals generally go way beyond any sane personal use, and make it easy to use the Deep Web as the supplier to launch your very own illicit business.T he Deep Web’s tradition of 4/20 sales goes back two years, when Silk Road’s dear leader and head marketer, Dread Pirate Roberts, announced a 4/20 sale to capture the world’s attention.Tony76 had become the site’s most popular vendor in just three months of operation by offering a top notch arsenal of highs ranging from heroin to marijuana. He jumped at the sale, offering big discounts and opening his shop to buyers outside of North America for the first time.“Orders flooded in from users well accustomed to receiving high quality goods from this seller and from new users, excited to have the chance to buy from such an esteemed identity,” reported Eileen Ormsby at All Things Vice.Tony sweetened the pot far beyond his usual offerings of drugs: “This 4/20, every 420 seconds, some lucky buyer will win one of our 420 great prizes!” wrote Tony. “From $50 gift certificates to a brand new iPhone 4s, some lucky person will be chosen every 420 seconds to win a prize.” The grand prize? A “trip for two with all the trimmings to paradise, all expenses included.”The money poured in.T ony wasn’t absolutely perfect, but what drug dealer is? Among his reams of positive reviews, occasional negativity found its way in.When packages were late, some customers got angry. But most of the delays seemed to not be Tony’s fault. After all, shipping packages cross-continent meant that any hiccup from mail services could cause significant wait times for customers. For every negative review, a dozen buyers came to Tony’s defense, proclaiming their love for their favorite Silk Road vendor—a stand up guy, they insisted, who had gained the trust of the community at large.By that April, Tony had made thousands of sales on Silk Road. When he went global for his 4/20 bonanza, the virtual line seemed to stretch into outer space.“Tony is the best,” wrote Silk Road user ijumz. “He will always come through. No one has any need to worry. I know he gets backed up with more pointless messages than I can even imagine and I’m not about to add to that. If you should have faith in anyone, then it should be the #1 vendor on SR!”Tony began his sale in March, so forward-thinking customers would receive their goods in time for 4/20 celebrations. But as the calendar turned to April, customers began to report claims of packages that arrived days and weeks late. Tony responded:Trust me guys, this is harder on me than it is on you. You may not believe me, but i stress out a ton when things are late because i’m always worried that people will think i am unreliable etc. I wish i had the option of offering something like DSN’s [tracking packages] anonymously, but the fact is that it is impossible in Canada to get tracking without being on camera somewhere.Other vendors were having similar shipping issues, said Tony’s defenders. The problem may have been in Canada’s postal system rather than a problem with Tony. Were they confiscating the packages? Was it low staffing and slow shipping? No one seemed to know the answers, and there was no place to find hints except from the anonymous posters on the Silk Road forum.“All these posts are really stressing me out,” wrote Tony. “To the point that it’s fucked up my mood and i have been in a shit mood all day.” When, eventually, more posters wrote that they’d received their packages of high-quality drugs, a happier Tony appeared on the board to say that a customer’s patience is always rewarded.“i’m #1 for a reason,” he concluded. “i take care of my customers. so don’t worry. I wont have anyone get fucked over. We’re in this together.”Business was up, but Tony’s problems persisted. He had been losing money by giving customers partial refunds for delayed packages. Problem was, he couldn’t verify the truth of most claims. Silk Road’s reputation system was broken, he said, because buyers could leave feedback for vendors, but vendors couldn’t leave feedback for buyers. He was being scammed, Tony claimed, and it was costing him money and his mental health.In a move apparently meant to beat the scammers, Tony began to require that all customers “finalize early”—paying directly to Tony, rather than putting their bitcoins—the only currency accepted on the Silk Road—into an escrow fund until the transaction was complete. Suddenly, the no. 1 vendor on Silk Road was requiring all of his customers to circumvent the very system that made Silk Road a success.This changed everything. One user, phubaiblues, summed up the Silk Road community’s response:Silk Road is based on TOR, escrow, and bitcoins. By requiring that everybody go out of escrow, we buyers have no recourse if things go badly. Escrow is here for a reason. I’m real uncomfortable when someone with good reputation is asked to finalize early.W ithin a week of April 20, 2012, it became clear that no one was receiving packages ordered during Tony’s giant 4/20 sale. Silk Road’s former golden child was accused of being a scam artist, the likes of which the black market had never seen. The massive trust that took just three months for Tony to build evaporated overnight.Tony’s victims began to tally the total damage. Based on the number of complaints and the volume ordered, Tony likely got away with at least $100,000. Some estimates range up to a quarter million dollars.Forum threads exploded and private messages flooded Tony’s inbox. He responded to precisely none of them. We know he saw the messages pile up because his last login date, April 25, 2012 at 09:51 p.m, came just as the tide of forum users against him hit its peak.“He’s been a member for 3 months only,” wrote Thor, a Silk Road user. “Nobody really knows him. Most big sellers know they can’t stay in business for too long. Tony probably just cashed out.”Days became weeks became months without a sign of life from the number one seller on Silk Road.D read Pirate Roberts, a notorious marketer as loud and self-assured as Steve Jobs, maintained a deafening silence as Tony bullied his way into a bigger bank account. But behind closed doors, court documents say, Dread Pirate Roberts—Ross Ulbricht, according to the FBI—burned at the theft from his black market.Before Tony, scammers were mere drops in an ocean. After Tony, the ocean began to turn black.One year after Tony’s big heist, authorities say, Roberts had taken a violent turn. Court documents accuse him of coordinating six murder-for-hires on people who threatened his business. Tony was to be victim number three.When Roberts’ muscle found that Tony lived and worked with three others in Surry, British Columbia, Roberts said he wanted to kill all four in order to have a “chance of recovering any potential product/money he may have,” and that “anything recovered would be split 50/50 with” the killers. Murdering all four would cost Roberts $500,000, an affordable fee for the Bitcoin-rich entrepreneur.On April 15, the would-be killer, known as redandwhite, told Roberts that the deed had been done. But Canadian and American authorities were never able to uncover any homicides in the area near Tony’s address.Today, Ulbricht sits in jail awaiting trial. And Tony—well, who knows where Tony went? Perhaps he saved that grand prize trip to paradise all for himself.Lead photo via Dank Depot/Flickr (CC BY 2.0)', 'Marvel ComicsThere once was a day when the idea of a gigantic superhero movie being made was little more than a fan dream. Then The Avengers happened and everything changed. Before Marvel brought their team to the big screen, superheroes stayed in their own movies, with their own characters and everyone was happy. Now we’ll never be happy.See The dream of a gigantic superhero movie didn’t go away after The Avengers, it just got bigger. So big that any glimmer of The X-Men appearing in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 or backroom deals to share the rights of characters between movie studios births the idea that a mega crossover is on the way. Avi Arad wants you to know that’s not going to happen for a long time. From Slashfilm:I think I’m probably a little bit of the militant here. I think it will take a moment in which we’ve run out of ideas. There’s so much to tell about Spider-Man. There’s so much to tell about the Sinister Six. The relationship between Spider-Man and Venom will bring a whole other world in… You know, in the toy business we used to make toys glow in the dark when they weren’t selling well and it gave at least another Christmas. We don’t need it yet.The quote comes from a video interview embedded below and it is kind of depressing all around if you’re really hoping for a big crossover event. Arad and Co-producer Matt Tolmach use the word “stunt” to express what a crossover film would entail. And as Russ Fischer as Slashfilm makes clear, a stunt would be a last gasp for an already tuckered out superhero genre.Dan talked about the inevitable superhero crash recently and any life support disguised as a crossover event isn’t going to help those matters any.Sony clearly has big ideas for Spider-Man and Fox is well noted to be working on something with the X-Men and Fantastic Four. We might be better off just enjoying what we have on our plate and not allowing our eyes to outweigh our stomachs.(Via Slashfilm)', 'In 2008, BMW introduced the X6 and created a new kind of car, the sport utility coupe.

The problem may have been in Canada’s postal system rather than a problem with Tony. Were they confiscating the packages? Was it low staffing and slow shipping? No one seemed to know the answers, and there was no place to find hints except from the anonymous posters on the Silk Road forum.“All these posts are really stressing me out,” wrote Tony. “To the point that it’s fucked up my mood and i have been in a shit mood all day.” When, eventually, more posters wrote that they’d received their packages of high-quality drugs, a happier Tony appeared on the board to say that a customer’s patience is always rewarded.“i’m #1 for a reason,” he concluded. “i take care of my customers. so don’t worry. I wont have anyone get fucked over. We’re in this together.”Business was up, but Tony’s problems persisted. He had been losing money by giving customers partial refunds for delayed packages. Problem was, he couldn’t verify the truth of most claims. Silk Road’s reputation system was broken, he said, because buyers could leave feedback for vendors, but vendors couldn’t leave feedback for buyers. He was being scammed, Tony claimed, and it was costing him money and his mental health.In a move apparently meant to beat the scammers, Tony began to require that all customers “finalize early”—paying directly to Tony, rather than putting their bitcoins—the only currency accepted on the Silk Road—into an escrow fund until the transaction was complete. Suddenly, the no. 1 vendor on Silk Road was requiring all of his customers to circumvent the very system that made Silk Road a success.This changed everything. One user, phubaiblues, summed up the Silk Road community’s response:Silk Road is based on TOR, escrow, and bitcoins. By requiring that everybody go out of escrow, we buyers have no recourse if things go badly. Escrow is here for a reason. I’m real uncomfortable when someone with good reputation is asked to finalize early.W ithin a week of April 20, 2012, it became clear that no one was receiving packages ordered during Tony’s giant 4/20 sale. Silk Road’s former golden child was accused of being a scam artist, the likes of which the black market had never seen. The massive trust that took just three months for Tony to build evaporated overnight.Tony’s victims began to tally the total damage. Based on the number of complaints and the volume ordered, Tony likely got away with at least $100,000. Some estimates range up to a quarter million dollars.Forum threads exploded and private messages flooded Tony’s inbox. He responded to precisely none of them. We know he saw the messages pile up because his last login date, April 25, 2012 at 09:51 p.m, came just as the tide of forum users against him hit its peak.“He’s been a member for 3 months only,” wrote Thor, a Silk Road user. “Nobody really knows him. Most big sellers know they can’t stay in business for too long. Tony probably just cashed out.”Days became weeks became months without a sign of life from the number one seller on Silk Road.D read Pirate Roberts, a notorious marketer as loud and self-assured as Steve Jobs, maintained a deafening silence as Tony bullied his way into a bigger bank account. But behind closed doors, court documents say, Dread Pirate Roberts—Ross Ulbricht, according to the FBI—burned at the theft from his black market.Before Tony, scammers were mere drops in an ocean. After Tony, the ocean began to turn black.One year after Tony’s big heist, authorities say, Roberts had taken a violent turn. Court documents accuse him of coordinating six murder-for-hires on people who threatened his business. Tony was to be victim number three.When Roberts’ muscle found that Tony lived and worked with three others in Surry, British Columbia, Roberts said he wanted to kill all four in order to have a “chance of recovering any potential product/money he may have,” and that “anything recovered would be split 50/50 with” the killers. Murdering all four would cost Roberts $500,000, an affordable fee for the Bitcoin-rich entrepreneur.On April 15, the would-be killer, known as redandwhite, told Roberts that the deed had been done. But Canadian and American authorities were never able to uncover any homicides in the area near Tony’s address.Today, Ulbricht sits in jail awaiting trial. And Tony—well, who knows where Tony went? Perhaps he saved that grand prize trip to paradise all for himself.Lead photo via Dank Depot/Flickr (CC BY 2.0)', 'Marvel ComicsThere once was a day when the idea of a gigantic superhero movie being made was little more than a fan dream. Then The Avengers happened and everything changed. Before Marvel brought their team to the big screen, superheroes stayed in their own movies, with their own characters and everyone was happy. Now we’ll never be happy.See The dream of a gigantic superhero movie didn’t go away after The Avengers, it just got bigger. So big that any glimmer of The X-Men appearing in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 or backroom deals to share the rights of characters between movie studios births the idea that a mega crossover is on the way. Avi Arad wants you to know that’s not going to happen for a long time. From Slashfilm:I think I’m probably a little bit of the militant here. I think it will take a moment in which we’ve run out of ideas. There’s so much to tell about Spider-Man. There’s so much to tell about the Sinister Six. The relationship between Spider-Man and Venom will bring a whole other world in… You know, in the toy business we used to make toys glow in the dark when they weren’t selling well and it gave at least another Christmas. We don’t need it yet.The quote comes from a video interview embedded below and it is kind of depressing all around if you’re really hoping for a big crossover event. Arad and Co-producer Matt Tolmach use the word “stunt” to express what a crossover film would entail. And as Russ Fischer as Slashfilm makes clear, a stunt would be a last gasp for an already tuckered out superhero genre.Dan talked about the inevitable superhero crash recently and any life support disguised as a crossover event isn’t going to help those matters any.Sony clearly has big ideas for Spider-Man and Fox is well noted to be working on something with the X-Men and Fantastic Four. We might be better off just enjoying what we have on our plate and not allowing our eyes to outweigh our stomachs.(Via Slashfilm)', 'In 2008, BMW introduced the X6 and created a new kind of car, the sport utility coupe. An odd blend of high-riding SUV and sporty coupe, the X6 was a hit.Now Mercedes-Benz is getting in on the action. Today at the Beijing Auto Show, the automaker unveiled the Concept Coupé SUV, a preview of its entry into the segment BMW created and now dominates.During a preview event at the New York Auto Show, Dr. Andreas Zygan, Mercedes\' chief engineer for sport utility vehicles, said the concept is ""unlike any we\'ve done before.""The concept is definitely headed for production, Mercedes says, and will sit a level below the 2015 GLA compact SUV. The automaker promises top of the line driving dynamics to make the funky looking car ""curve hungry,"" and says it combines the ""best of both worlds.""Asked during the preview if the Concept Coupé SUV is a copy of the BMW X6, global communications chief Christoph Horn simply said, ""customers love more choices.""Here\'s a closer look at the new Benz:For its part, BMW is diving deeper into the emergent coupe-SUV segment.

Hemen aşağıdaki grafikte T.C. Gençlik ve Spor Bakanlığı’nın yaptığı; Gençlik ve Sosyal Medya Araştırması 2013’e göre ülkemizde cinsiyet, yaş ve en son mezun olduğu okula göre insanların sosyal medya kullanıp kullanmadıklarına bakabilirsiniz.Aşağıdaki grafikte toplam olarak tüm internet kullanıcılarının baz alındığını ve ‘en son mezun olduğu okul’ verisine, halen öğrenci olanlaırn dahil edilmediğini de hemen ekleyelim.Facebook’un da bir sosyal medya platformu sayılması ve ülkemizde 30 milyonun üzerinde Facebook üyesinin olduğunu düşünecek olursak söz konusu araştırmaya göre ülkemizin toplamda yüzde 95,5‘i sosyal medya kullanıyor. Bu oran yükseköğretim mezunlarına baktığımızda yüzde 97,4‘e kadar çıkıyor. Ortaöğretim ve altında ise aynı oran yüzde 93. Bu da eğitimin sosyal medya kullanımıyla doğru orantılı bir ilişkisi olduğunu gösteriyor.Diğer yandan erkeklerin yüzde 5,3‘ü; kadınların da yüzde 3,8‘i sosyal medya kullanmıyor. Bu da kadınların erkeklere nazaran daha çok sosyal medya kullandığını gösteriyor. Ayrıca 15-17 yaş grubunda kullanım oranı yüzde 95,1, 18-24 grubunda yüzde 94,7 ve 25-29’da da yüzde 96,7 olarak hesaplanmış.Nedir bu Webrazzi PRO?Webrazzi PRO, içerisinde internet sektörüne dair 1000’in üzerinde veri bulunduran bir bilgi merkezi.

04/26/2014,"['The economies of the developing world will feel the earliest and greatest impact from bitcoin. Not only are bitcoin\'s enormous benefits very personal, they are also contextual depending on your political geography.Individuals residing in high-inflation countries with relatively sufficient Internet access as a percentage of population do seek refuge in bitcoin.The worst offenders depriving their subjects of monetary stability or a reasonable – albeit \'coerced\' – store of value are the dictatorial regimes in politically tumultuous countries like Belarus, Sudan, Syria, Iran, Ethiopia, Malawi, Venezuela, Burundi, Yemen, and Tanzania.Incidentally, those countries also form the top 10 country list for annual inflation rate according to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund data for 2012.High-inflation promotes bitcoinTopping the list is Ukraine\'s neighbour Belarus, with an annual inflation rate of 59.2%. Ruled by President Alexander Lukashenko since 1994, Belarus is known as Europe\'s last dictatorship. While shocking, that inflation rate is actually down from 2011, when a financial crisis triggered a peak rate of 109%.Venezuela comes in at #7 worldwide, with an annual inflation rate of 21.1%. Price controls, capital flight, food shortages, and electricity blackouts are now pushing Venezuela toward the brink.The Heritage Foundation\'s Index of Economic Freedom highlights the massive potential for bitcoin in a world of abusive monetary authorities.Not surprisingly, these countries also rank very low for Internet penetration as a percentage of country\'s total population when compared to US at 81.0% and UK at 87.0%.Internet penetration as percentage of total populationWhere it becomes interesting is when we look at high-inflation monetary regimes coupled with strong and growing Internet penetration. Notably, the countries with the highest inflation rates that also have reasonable access to Internet connectivity tend to be relatively active on the bitcoin network of active global nodes.Belarus with 46.9% Internet penetration, Venezuela with 44.0%, India with 12.6%, Vietnam with 39.5%, and Turkey with 45.1% are all disproportionately high outlets for active bitcoin nodes (ranking #51, #50, #54, #48, and #45 respectively). These countries are also in the top rankings for annual inflation with rates exceeding 9% or 10% during 2012.Argentina demonstrates the prime example of bitcoin solving an issue of monetary justice related to persistent debasement of the national currency (the peso).The country has merely 55.8% Internet penetration as a percentage of total population and yet ranks #26 in terms of active bitcoin nodes globally. Clearly, Argentinians have a strong desire to protect their long-term purchasing power and regain control over their monetary lives.High inflation rates coupled with high Internet connectivity tends to lead to bitcoin.Graphic: World map of 24-hour relative average utilization of IPv4 addresses observed using ICMP ping requests as part of the Internet Census of 2012 (Carna Botnet), June - October 2012.Key: from red (high), to yellow, green (average), light blue, and dark blue (low).Increased purchasing power Certainly, bitcoin exhibits short term volatility as a young medium of exchange attempting to find its footing against the tide of sporadic liquidity, bank account closures, and government-threatened bans.In the intermediate term, bitcoin\'s predictable scarcity makes it a sought-after commodity when compared to fiat currencies. Bitcoin\'s price chart is a story of price appreciation, or increased purchasing power, for the decentralized currency and its global community of users.Time horizon is important and indeed bitcoin can be seen as either currency or commodity, as the IRS has recently affirmed.Measured over two years in USD, bitcoin exhibits tremendous increases in purchasing power and, in that way, bitcoin is similar to gold. Another way of examining bitcoin purchasing power is to express the gold price in BTC. It is rare that a national, or centralized, fiat currency with predictable depreciation would retain or increase its purchasing power in such a way.Split appealWe can kid ourselves that the US or EU won\'t see the types of inflation rates that we see from the world\'s worst offenders because, for now, the USD and the euro have privileged reserve currency status and this mitigates or absorbs the hidden abuse.The primary appeal of bitcoin in the developed world is the retention of some remnants of privacy and the occasional opportunity to challenge the monopolistic payment giants like VISA and PayPal. Not so in the the still developing regions where other bitcoin attributes take precedence.In addition to bitcoin as a digital store of value across all jurisdictions, bitcoin\'s resiliency to shutdown and immunity from confiscation lie at the heart of its monetary justice properties.Moreover, fear not deflation, for deflation is the friend of liberty.As economist Jörg Guido Hülsmann argues, a much-feared deflationary spiral would not prove fatal to the lives and welfare of the general population. Rather, it would destroy ""essentially those companies and industries that live a parasitical existence at the expense of the rest of the economy, and which owe their existence to our present money system.""Or more bluntly, ""deflation is a mortal enemy to the heavily indebted state and its embedded parasites, but it is a friend to the saver and to anyone with a positive net worth.""Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of, and should not be attributed to, CoinDesk.Follow the author on Twitter.Bitcoin image via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It’s exchanged globally between those who collect it and those who accept it as payment. The value fluctuates; each is worth about $500 now.When two Stanford University grads wanted to start a bitcoin company, they looked for the lowest power rates in the country.A map comparing energy rates led them to Central Washington, where hydroelectric dams churn out electricity that costs industrial customers less than 3 cents per kilowatt.HashPlex, the business launched by Bernie Rihn and George Schnurle, is one of several bitcoin mining companies operating or preparing to launch in Grant, Chelan and Douglas counties. All three counties have public utility districts that offer very low power rates to industrial customers.In this case, mining has nothing to do with metals. It’s the term in the tech world for how the virtual currency bitcoin is made.Bitcoins are a form of currency composed of long, unique strings of digital characters. Each bitcoin can be used or exchanged by people who accept it as a form of payment. Its value fluctuates with supply and demand; each bitcoin currently is worth about $500.It can’t be easily counterfeited and is owned anonymously, making it popular for digital and international transactions.Explaining the complex system of how many bitcoins are “mined” reads like a course in cryptography and electrical engineering. In short, a person can mine bitcoins by using computers to crunch vast amounts of data until they generate a unique code or “block.” That block has to be compared against all other existing blocks and then validated.At that point the operator has created a set of valid bitcoins that are registered across the worldwide network of bitcoins. Currently, the bitcoin mining rules limit global production to about 25 every 10 minutes.Rihn and Schnurle and others in the bitcoin mining industry never announce grand openings or open houses. Because they generate a virtual currency that has real monetary value, the managers of bitcoin mining firms don’t disclose locations.Patrick Boss, government affairs specialist with the Port of Quincy, said the heightened interest in Central Washington stems from a word-of-mouth awareness among entrepreneurs.“I am only personally aware of two bitcoin mining firms locating in Grant County,” Boss said. “But I’ve been told that at least five others are in the process of locating in the area.”Until a few years ago, no one in Grant County – or most other places – knew what a bitcoin is. Now business leaders there understand that bitcoin mining is the latest wave of technology business chasing dirt-cheap power, following tech companies like Dell, Microsoft, Intuit and Yahoo, which erected large data centers in Grant County.Emily Braunwart, accounting and communications manager with the Grant County Economic Development Council, said her group is not actively recruiting bitcoin mining firms.“We have been getting some calls of interest by those companies and most of that is because they’re finding us,” Braunwart said.In a warehouse near Wenatchee in Douglas County, Everett entrepreneur Dave Carlson runs a bitcoin business called MegaBigPower. It’s one of three MegaBigPower sites, including one in Poland.Inside the 5,000- square-foot building are long rows of racks and shelves holding computer boards connected by cables to hundreds of other computer servers that keep track of what the boards are doing.Carlson has been featured in several major publications, where he’s said his business is likely the largest bitcoin mining business in the United States.Like Rihn, he doesn’t want to disclose his specific location.Carlson said his facility, which has about 10 employees, has roughly 1 million computer chips working together churning through huge piles of data. On average, his company produces around 100 bitcoins per day, or at the current dollar-to-bitcoin exchange, roughly $50,000 per day.Carlson quickly explained that most of the revenue goes to a principal investor, a European businessman who invested most of the capital to start the company.In a recent online article, Carlson said his own take is roughly 10 to 20 percent of the coins generated.Mining those bitcoins is costing Carlson roughly $50,000 per month in PUD power bills. That’s for the energy to drive the computer chips and operate hundreds of fans that pull heat from the building.Because of how the bitcoin universe operates, as more and more miners worldwide compete against each other to produce bitcoins, the computational effort for each new set of bitcoins requires more time and more power, he said.Two years ago people could download software on their home computers and generate bitcoins, even though the process took lots of time, Carlson said.Carlson said the arms race among bitcoin miners isn’t just to find the cheapest power rates.“It’s also about designing computer boards and processing chips that are even more efficient than what we have now,” he said.Rihn and Schnurle’s business plan is to be a server farm or host for bitcoin miners who don’t have the space or access to low-cost energy to operate efficiently.HashPlex invites those miners – whether large-scale or mom-and-pop size – to send their customized mining computers to its Washington facility. HashPlex won’t own those machines, but its staff will manage the equipment and keep them linked to the bitcoin network and working properly.HashPlex will charge a fee based on the amount of electricity the individual mining machines consume, Rihn said. He didn’t have a date for when the new HashPlex building will open. The company recently opened a mining facility in south Seattle, Rihn said.', 'The world around us can be portrayed by an artist’s perception in a unique way that allows imaginations to run freely. The physical world has been mimicked many times to give off different takes of our own perceptions and beliefs of what we can see. But what about creating art based on a metaphysical concept? A concept like bitcoin?In actuality, bitcoins only exist in the digital space as numbers on screens. However, that didn’t stop some talented artists in making bitcoin aesthetically pleasing to the human eye. They took the concept of bitcoin and news surrounding it to come up with some of the most creative art filled expressions of bitcoin one could possibly imagine.Top 5: Bitcoin Inspired ArtsHere is a look at the top 5 bitcoin inspired works of art to come out of the minds of bitcoin enthused artists.5. BitSoapShown off at San Francisco’s Bitcoin Art Fair; along with various other bitcoin inspired works, Bitsoaps are handcrafted bars of soap that show an appreciation to digital currencies. Each soap molded in the shape of a circle, and has a digital currency-related image in the center. One version of the scented soap has the familiar bitcoin symbol across it, while another has the adorable dogecoin mascot plastered on the bath-time instrument.In addition to paying respect to bitcoin history in the form of soap art, Bitsoaps are sold exclusively for bitcoin. The Bitsoap site states:“We believe bitcoins have a value independent of exchange rates with other currencies. these soaps are our contribution to the native bitcoin economy.”Bitsoap has definitely proven loyal to bitcoin, both financially and in good taste.4. Mount GoxBitcoin history, just as all history, has its good and its bad moments in time. The digital currency community will never forget the tragedy that was the collapse of Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.Artist Thomas-Joseph Carrieri also exhibited his works at the San Francisco Bitcoin Art Fair, one of them serving as a reminder to when bitcoin hit a crucial road bump in its early existence. Carrieri’s Mount Gox takes the name of the exchange to heart, as a mountain is the focus of his work. However, what is more eye-grabbing is that he based the piece off of the popular card playing game, Magic: the Gathering.Each Magic card works to strengthen a player’s deck to try and outwit an opponent. The caption on Carrieri’s card reads: “Add Bitcoin to your mana pool.” His work manages to bring together three different realms in one image. The realm of card games, the art world, and bitcoin.3. Man Uses Mycelium AppMegan Miller is an artist based out of Los Angeles. She wanted to bring the digital world of bitcoin to life using her passion of taking pictures. The task may not make much sense, as bitcoins are not physical objects. So, how could one use a camera to capture them?This puzzling dilemma was no puzzle for Miller, as she snaps photos of bitcoin being used in everyday life. That means people who are interacting with bitcoin end up being her works of bitcoin art. Her curiosity and passion to make art through the camera’s lens pushed her to learn more about the digital currency.In one of her photos, a man is seen scanning a QR code with a smartphone. This shows off bitcoin’s efficiency, as the user is sitting on a bench with his dog. Bitcoin transactions can be made so simply, without the need of a third party. Miller’s pictures portray moments in time for those using bitcoin, as well as bitcoin’s technology.This also goes to show that art can be anything the mind wants art to be, since art is in the eye of the beholder.2. Satoshi NakamotoWhether we look at the inside of a technological device, or the images and services they produce, technology is a major form of art. In Jeff Gomes’ painting titled Satoshi Nakamoto, Gomes pays tribute to one of the most intellectual minds of our time.Known to be the mystery man behind bitcoin, Nakamoto is believed to be a man or small anonymous group that came up with bitcoin’s encrypted technology. Nevertheless, Gomes represents Nakamoto’s genius and secret identity with his piece, which was also showcased at the Bitcoin Art Fair on March 6th.The piece offers insight on what the inside of Nakamoto’s brilliant mind may look like, while somewhat concealing his identity. In the portrait, Nakamoto’s head is filled with blocks of bitcoin knowledge that would have never seen the light of day without his doing.1. 200 BitcoinsKuna Goda’s 200 Bitcoins pays homage to not only bitcoin, but to the inspiration that set the basis of the work’s art style. Andy Warhol’s 200 One Dollar Bills put the gears in motion for Goda to make his own money-related piece.What truly made the spirit of bitcoin come to life in this piece was that it was sold in bitcoin. However, both Goda and the buyer have agreed to not reveal the exact sale price. It is said that the buyer spent less than $90,000 in bitcoin on the work.Goda explained his reasoning for his piece, saying:“As a lifelong fan of Andy Warhol I knew that he connected money and art in his 1962 Dollar Bill series, which featured 200 one dollar bills. I thought Bitcoin deserves the same and so I created ’200 Bitcoins’. I think Warhol once said that one should rather frame and hang the money itself on the wall than buying art with it. I always liked that way of thinking.”Goda bases most of his art off of technology. He says that his follow up to 200 Bitcoins will also incorporate the theme of money. It will identify the critical state of the US dollar.Artistic freedom is one of the most vocal forms of expression out there. For creators to devote time and effort shows how truly bitcoin is to them. Bitcoin has the power to change the financial world for the better. Paying respect to it by allowing to be seen in a positive light is daring and remarkable.It will be interesting to see what other empowered artists create using the concept of bitcoin.Let us know some of your favorite works of bitcoin inspired art in the comments below.Featured Image', 'Ngân hàng Bitcoin đóng cửa vì trộm / Sàn giao dịch Bitcoin đầu tiên tại Việt Nam tuyên bố thành lậpThời gian qua, tiền ảo Bitcoin được nhắc tới ngày càng nhiều và đã trở nên phổ biến tại một số quốc gia, như Đức và Singapore đã công nhận đồng tiền này, nhiều sàn giao dịch và doanh nghiệp cũng bắt đầu chấp nhận thanh toán bằng Bitcoin. Tuy nhiên, hầu hết các nước, trong đó có Việt Nam đã tuyên bố cấm hoặc không bảo trợ đồng tiền này như một phương tiện thanh toán.Lý do chính là giao dịch Bitcoin gặp rất nhiều rủi ro. ""Rủi ro đối với hệ thống tài chính quốc tế giảm dần, song rủi ro đối với các nhà đầu tư đã tham gia đào và giao dịch các đồng tiền này ngày càng lớn hơn, nhất là sau khi sàn giao dịch Mt.Gox tuyên bố phá sản"", báo cáo mới công bố của Ủy ban Kinh tế Quốc hội nhận định. Bên cạnh đó, các đồng tiền này có thể phục vụ hoạt động rửa tiền, tài trợ cho khủng bố…Dù tiềm ẩn nhiều rủi ro nhưng Bitcoin lại ngày càng phát triển và phổ biến. Ảnh: BloombergVướng phải nhiều rắc rối pháp lý, song trên thực tế Bitcoin ngày càng phát triển. Nhiều dịch vụ như thanh toán học phí, mua bán qua mạng, thanh toán một số hàng hóa như cà phê, máy đổi tiền sang Bitcoin… vẫn tồn tại và nằm ngoài ý muốn chủ quan của cơ quan quản lý cũng như các ngân hàng trung ương.Tại Việt Nam, công ty TNHH Bitcoin Việt Nam cho biết đã hợp tác với một doanh nghiệp ở Israel để lập sàn giao dịch trực tuyến, dự kiến sẽ ra mắt cuối tháng 4. Trên một số diễn đàn, cụm từ ""Bitcoin accepted here"" (Bitcoin được chấp nhận thanh toán tại đây) cũng được nhắc tới.Song, lãnh đạo Cục Thương mại Điện tử (Bộ Công Thương) khẳng định Bitcoin không thuộc đối tượng được chấp nhận thanh toán do chưa được quy định là hàng hóa hay dịch vụ trong bất cứ văn bản quy phạm pháp lý hiện hành nào. Trong thông cáo báo chí phát đi cuối tháng 2/2014, Ngân hàng Nhà nước cũng khẳng định tiền ảo, bao gồm Bitcoin không phải là tiền tệ và phương tiện thanh toán hợp pháp tại Việt Nam.Cơ quan này cảnh báo việc sở hữu, mua bán, sử dụng Bitcoin như là một loại tài sản tiềm ẩn rất nhiều rủi ro và không được pháp luật bảo vệ. ""Bitcoin không bị chi phối và kiểm soát giao dịch bởi cơ quan quản lý nhà nước nào, do đó, người sở hữu Bitcoin sẽ chịu toàn bộ rủi ro vì không có cơ chế bảo vệ quyền lợi"", Ngân hàng Nhà nước cho biết.Đề đề phòng các trường hợp xấu xảy ra, Ủy ban Kinh tế khuyến nghị cần đánh giá sớm và đầy đủ những tác động có thể của tiền “ngang hàng” (gồm Bitcoin) và chuẩn bị các chiến lược ứng phó chủ động.Bitcoin bắt đầu được giao dịch trên sàn Mt.Gox (trụ sở Tokyo, Nhật Bản) vào tháng 6/2010, đến năm 2013 được sử dụng trên cả phương diện thanh toán, giao dịch hàng hóa và tài sản đầu tư tại nhiều quốc gia. Đồng tiền này có được nhờ nỗ lực khai thác của thành viên tham gia mạng máy tính, với mức độ khó khăn tăng dần theo số thành viên và số tiền đào được giảm dần theo thời gian. Bitcoin cũng không do một thực thể duy nhất chịu trách nhiệm phát hành, bảo đảm và thực hiện chức năng thanh toán bù trừ.Phương Linh', 'The car of the week is the 2014 VW Passat SEL Premium, the top-shelf version of Volkswagen of America’s midsize sedan (Hyundai Sonata, Honda Accord, Ford Fusion), powered by a new turbocharged 1.8-liter four cylinder, replacing the naturally aspirated 2.5-liter five as the base engine.Sleepy yet?However, I find this car is endlessly fascinating. Redesigned for model-year 2011, this generation of Passat represents everything the German giant VOW3, -0.26% VLKPY, -0.62% thought it understood about the American market. The vehicle itself is upsized specifically for the U.S., as compared with its global namesake. It is conservatively tailored and tuned to American tastes. It is even built in the glorious right-to-work paradise of Chattanooga, Tenn.The price isn’t outrageous. Our test car, with touch-screen navi, premium audio and sliding sunroof, was $31,715. And VW is nothing less than a world-heritage brand, something that through humanity’s common experience over decades now belongs to all of us, something we all love. A great brand, an Immortal.Dan NeilAnd yet, the Passat is laying siege to the segment basement, with sales down 6.3% through March, even with the new, more fuel-efficient (24/34 mpg, city/highway) four-cylinder engine available. Zoom out, and the picture is even bleaker. In a torrid U.S. market — a March seasonally adjusted rate of 16.3 million, near an all-time high — VWA sold 36,717 vehicles in March, having its head handed to it by, for example, Subaru (44,479). Eleven of VWA’s 13 models saw sales decline in the first three months of the year.At that rate, VW’s U.S. footprint is wildly, hilariously oversize, and excess capacity is one thing German auto executives positively hate.Now would be a good time to panic, but VW executives stationed in Herndon, Va., and Wolfsburg have committed to no more than what is known in the trades as a midmodel refresh, which sounds like something you would find on a fashion shoot. At the Geneva auto show in March, VWA chief Michael Horn — a German executive who in December succeeded Jon Browning, a Brit — assured reporters that the Passat was getting a face-lift for the 2016 model year, with new features, content and “fresh” styling.Well, may I say, chief, that is a leisurely timeline. Your house will have been burning a good four years by the time the fire brigade arrives.Now, why is any of this relevant to tire-kickers out cross shopping the Passat? Because, if you go to a car dealership and look at any car, you are looking at a moment in time, design-wise. Cars have life cycles and generations, and VW Group — as part of its decadelong quest for global domination — has embraced longer product life cycles to save money. In other words, the company changes its product less frequently than its competitors (a slower product “tempo” is the term of art). Not much, probably only 90-120 days in the case of Passat. But cumulatively, VW brand turns over its fleet more slowly than competitors, saving millions of euros in the process, at least on the front end.And that might be OK, if VW’s U.S. products had sufficient shelf life.Yeah, but . . . no.And it might be OK if the exterior design had legs. But VW’s design philosophy of late has favored a dignified, if perishable restraint (e.g., Passat). Meanwhile, the competition has produced some real lookers, including Fusion and Mazda6.In the U.S. midsize, midprice-sedan segment — absolutely frantic with innovation and competition — the Passat is suffering accelerated decrepitude, like the crew on that one Star Trek episode. And its five-year mission still has one year to go.The Passat’s general expiry can be illustrated on a number of fronts, but the new 1.8-liter gas-turbo, direct-injection in-line four is a good example. New for 2014 and late to the party, the 1.8T nonetheless works well, with adequate output (170 hp) and a free-revving, flexible character (184 pound feet of torque broadly spread between 1,500 and 4,750 rpm). But compared with Fusion’s 2.0-liter EcoBoost (231/270) or the Hyundai Sonata 2.0-liter (274/269) the VW tiny turbo feels one whole generation behind the curve.Are there any bright spots in the Passat lineup? Actually, one does jump out at me. The Passat is available with a 2.0-liter turbodiesel engine (31/43 mpg, city/highway when paired with a six-speed manual transmission). A diesel with a manual tranny is the ultimate auto-journo special.The maddening thing about the Passat is that most of its disadvantages are comparative. On its own, it is a comfortable, spacious sedan with very able, European handling. But when you start running the value-proposition numbers, comparing it with more rapidly evolving competitors, it quickly gets hopeless. I mean, look at the equipment list for, say, the Honda Accord EX-L with Navigation. The latter comes with a brace of driver-support systems the VW doesn’t have: forward collision alert, lane-departure warning, multiangle-rearview camera, LED taillamps and a lot more.The saving grace for VW is that modern car building is an iterative process. The tweaking goes on. VW is selling a sport version of the Passat, with a bin of go-fast cosmetics to help sales. And sometime next year a heavily revised Passat will arrive, incorporating as many lessons learned as the paymasters in Wolfsburg will allow.Until then VW’s quintessential Yankee Wagen will be residing in Valley Forge.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Lincoln MKZ isn’t a full mealRolls-Royce Wraith: Drive it like you own the placeNice curves at the New York auto show']","['The economies of the developing world will feel the earliest and greatest impact from bitcoin. Not only are bitcoin\'s enormous benefits very personal, they are also contextual depending on your political geography.Individuals residing in high-inflation countries with relatively sufficient Internet access as a percentage of population do seek refuge in bitcoin.The worst offenders depriving their subjects of monetary stability or a reasonable – albeit \'coerced\' – store of value are the dictatorial regimes in politically tumultuous countries like Belarus, Sudan, Syria, Iran, Ethiopia, Malawi, Venezuela, Burundi, Yemen, and Tanzania.Incidentally, those countries also form the top 10 country list for annual inflation rate according to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund data for 2012.High-inflation promotes bitcoinTopping the list is Ukraine\'s neighbour Belarus, with an annual inflation rate of 59.2%. Ruled by President Alexander Lukashenko since 1994, Belarus is known as Europe\'s last dictatorship. While shocking, that inflation rate is actually down from 2011, when a financial crisis triggered a peak rate of 109%.Venezuela comes in at #7 worldwide, with an annual inflation rate of 21.1%. Price controls, capital flight, food shortages, and electricity blackouts are now pushing Venezuela toward the brink.The Heritage Foundation\'s Index of Economic Freedom highlights the massive potential for bitcoin in a world of abusive monetary authorities.Not surprisingly, these countries also rank very low for Internet penetration as a percentage of country\'s total population when compared to US at 81.0% and UK at 87.0%.Internet penetration as percentage of total populationWhere it becomes interesting is when we look at high-inflation monetary regimes coupled with strong and growing Internet penetration. Notably, the countries with the highest inflation rates that also have reasonable access to Internet connectivity tend to be relatively active on the bitcoin network of active global nodes.Belarus with 46.9% Internet penetration, Venezuela with 44.0%, India with 12.6%, Vietnam with 39.5%, and Turkey with 45.1% are all disproportionately high outlets for active bitcoin nodes (ranking #51, #50, #54, #48, and #45 respectively). These countries are also in the top rankings for annual inflation with rates exceeding 9% or 10% during 2012.Argentina demonstrates the prime example of bitcoin solving an issue of monetary justice related to persistent debasement of the national currency (the peso).The country has merely 55.8% Internet penetration as a percentage of total population and yet ranks #26 in terms of active bitcoin nodes globally. Clearly, Argentinians have a strong desire to protect their long-term purchasing power and regain control over their monetary lives.High inflation rates coupled with high Internet connectivity tends to lead to bitcoin.Graphic: World map of 24-hour relative average utilization of IPv4 addresses observed using ICMP ping requests as part of the Internet Census of 2012 (Carna Botnet), June - October 2012.Key: from red (high), to yellow, green (average), light blue, and dark blue (low).Increased purchasing power Certainly, bitcoin exhibits short term volatility as a young medium of exchange attempting to find its footing against the tide of sporadic liquidity, bank account closures, and government-threatened bans.In the intermediate term, bitcoin\'s predictable scarcity makes it a sought-after commodity when compared to fiat currencies. Bitcoin\'s price chart is a story of price appreciation, or increased purchasing power, for the decentralized currency and its global community of users.Time horizon is important and indeed bitcoin can be seen as either currency or commodity, as the IRS has recently affirmed.Measured over two years in USD, bitcoin exhibits tremendous increases in purchasing power and, in that way, bitcoin is similar to gold. Another way of examining bitcoin purchasing power is to express the gold price in BTC. It is rare that a national, or centralized, fiat currency with predictable depreciation would retain or increase its purchasing power in such a way.Split appealWe can kid ourselves that the US or EU won\'t see the types of inflation rates that we see from the world\'s worst offenders because, for now, the USD and the euro have privileged reserve currency status and this mitigates or absorbs the hidden abuse.The primary appeal of bitcoin in the developed world is the retention of some remnants of privacy and the occasional opportunity to challenge the monopolistic payment giants like VISA and PayPal. Not so in the the still developing regions where other bitcoin attributes take precedence.In addition to bitcoin as a digital store of value across all jurisdictions, bitcoin\'s resiliency to shutdown and immunity from confiscation lie at the heart of its monetary justice properties.Moreover, fear not deflation, for deflation is the friend of liberty.As economist Jörg Guido Hülsmann argues, a much-feared deflationary spiral would not prove fatal to the lives and welfare of the general population. Rather, it would destroy ""essentially those companies and industries that live a parasitical existence at the expense of the rest of the economy, and which owe their existence to our present money system.""Or more bluntly, ""deflation is a mortal enemy to the heavily indebted state and its embedded parasites, but it is a friend to the saver and to anyone with a positive net worth.""Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of, and should not be attributed to, CoinDesk.Follow the author on Twitter.Bitcoin image via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It’s exchanged globally between those who collect it and those who accept it as payment. The value fluctuates; each is worth about $500 now.When two Stanford University grads wanted to start a bitcoin company, they looked for the lowest power rates in the country.A map comparing energy rates led them to Central Washington, where hydroelectric dams churn out electricity that costs industrial customers less than 3 cents per kilowatt.HashPlex, the business launched by Bernie Rihn and George Schnurle, is one of several bitcoin mining companies operating or preparing to launch in Grant, Chelan and Douglas counties. All three counties have public utility districts that offer very low power rates to industrial customers.In this case, mining has nothing to do with metals. It’s the term in the tech world for how the virtual currency bitcoin is made.Bitcoins are a form of currency composed of long, unique strings of digital characters. Each bitcoin can be used or exchanged by people who accept it as a form of payment. Its value fluctuates with supply and demand; each bitcoin currently is worth about $500.It can’t be easily counterfeited and is owned anonymously, making it popular for digital and international transactions.Explaining the complex system of how many bitcoins are “mined” reads like a course in cryptography and electrical engineering. In short, a person can mine bitcoins by using computers to crunch vast amounts of data until they generate a unique code or “block.” That block has to be compared against all other existing blocks and then validated.At that point the operator has created a set of valid bitcoins that are registered across the worldwide network of bitcoins. Currently, the bitcoin mining rules limit global production to about 25 every 10 minutes.Rihn and Schnurle and others in the bitcoin mining industry never announce grand openings or open houses. Because they generate a virtual currency that has real monetary value, the managers of bitcoin mining firms don’t disclose locations.Patrick Boss, government affairs specialist with the Port of Quincy, said the heightened interest in Central Washington stems from a word-of-mouth awareness among entrepreneurs.“I am only personally aware of two bitcoin mining firms locating in Grant County,” Boss said. “But I’ve been told that at least five others are in the process of locating in the area.”Until a few years ago, no one in Grant County – or most other places – knew what a bitcoin is. Now business leaders there understand that bitcoin mining is the latest wave of technology business chasing dirt-cheap power, following tech companies like Dell, Microsoft, Intuit and Yahoo, which erected large data centers in Grant County.Emily Braunwart, accounting and communications manager with the Grant County Economic Development Council, said her group is not actively recruiting bitcoin mining firms.“We have been getting some calls of interest by those companies and most of that is because they’re finding us,” Braunwart said.In a warehouse near Wenatchee in Douglas County, Everett entrepreneur Dave Carlson runs a bitcoin business called MegaBigPower.

""Rủi ro đối với hệ thống tài chính quốc tế giảm dần, song rủi ro đối với các nhà đầu tư đã tham gia đào và giao dịch các đồng tiền này ngày càng lớn hơn, nhất là sau khi sàn giao dịch Mt.Gox tuyên bố phá sản"", báo cáo mới công bố của Ủy ban Kinh tế Quốc hội nhận định. Bên cạnh đó, các đồng tiền này có thể phục vụ hoạt động rửa tiền, tài trợ cho khủng bố…Dù tiềm ẩn nhiều rủi ro nhưng Bitcoin lại ngày càng phát triển và phổ biến. Ảnh: BloombergVướng phải nhiều rắc rối pháp lý, song trên thực tế Bitcoin ngày càng phát triển. Nhiều dịch vụ như thanh toán học phí, mua bán qua mạng, thanh toán một số hàng hóa như cà phê, máy đổi tiền sang Bitcoin… vẫn tồn tại và nằm ngoài ý muốn chủ quan của cơ quan quản lý cũng như các ngân hàng trung ương.Tại Việt Nam, công ty TNHH Bitcoin Việt Nam cho biết đã hợp tác với một doanh nghiệp ở Israel để lập sàn giao dịch trực tuyến, dự kiến sẽ ra mắt cuối tháng 4. Trên một số diễn đàn, cụm từ ""Bitcoin accepted here"" (Bitcoin được chấp nhận thanh toán tại đây) cũng được nhắc tới.Song, lãnh đạo Cục Thương mại Điện tử (Bộ Công Thương) khẳng định Bitcoin không thuộc đối tượng được chấp nhận thanh toán do chưa được quy định là hàng hóa hay dịch vụ trong bất cứ văn bản quy phạm pháp lý hiện hành nào. Trong thông cáo báo chí phát đi cuối tháng 2/2014, Ngân hàng Nhà nước cũng khẳng định tiền ảo, bao gồm Bitcoin không phải là tiền tệ và phương tiện thanh toán hợp pháp tại Việt Nam.Cơ quan này cảnh báo việc sở hữu, mua bán, sử dụng Bitcoin như là một loại tài sản tiềm ẩn rất nhiều rủi ro và không được pháp luật bảo vệ. ""Bitcoin không bị chi phối và kiểm soát giao dịch bởi cơ quan quản lý nhà nước nào, do đó, người sở hữu Bitcoin sẽ chịu toàn bộ rủi ro vì không có cơ chế bảo vệ quyền lợi"", Ngân hàng Nhà nước cho biết.Đề đề phòng các trường hợp xấu xảy ra, Ủy ban Kinh tế khuyến nghị cần đánh giá sớm và đầy đủ những tác động có thể của tiền “ngang hàng” (gồm Bitcoin) và chuẩn bị các chiến lược ứng phó chủ động.Bitcoin bắt đầu được giao dịch trên sàn Mt.Gox (trụ sở Tokyo, Nhật Bản) vào tháng 6/2010, đến năm 2013 được sử dụng trên cả phương diện thanh toán, giao dịch hàng hóa và tài sản đầu tư tại nhiều quốc gia. Đồng tiền này có được nhờ nỗ lực khai thác của thành viên tham gia mạng máy tính, với mức độ khó khăn tăng dần theo số thành viên và số tiền đào được giảm dần theo thời gian. Bitcoin cũng không do một thực thể duy nhất chịu trách nhiệm phát hành, bảo đảm và thực hiện chức năng thanh toán bù trừ.Phương Linh', 'The car of the week is the 2014 VW Passat SEL Premium, the top-shelf version of Volkswagen of America’s midsize sedan (Hyundai Sonata, Honda Accord, Ford Fusion), powered by a new turbocharged 1.8-liter four cylinder, replacing the naturally aspirated 2.5-liter five as the base engine.Sleepy yet?However, I find this car is endlessly fascinating. Redesigned for model-year 2011, this generation of Passat represents everything the German giant VOW3, -0.26% VLKPY, -0.62% thought it understood about the American market. The vehicle itself is upsized specifically for the U.S., as compared with its global namesake. It is conservatively tailored and tuned to American tastes. It is even built in the glorious right-to-work paradise of Chattanooga, Tenn.The price isn’t outrageous. Our test car, with touch-screen navi, premium audio and sliding sunroof, was $31,715. And VW is nothing less than a world-heritage brand, something that through humanity’s common experience over decades now belongs to all of us, something we all love. A great brand, an Immortal.Dan NeilAnd yet, the Passat is laying siege to the segment basement, with sales down 6.3% through March, even with the new, more fuel-efficient (24/34 mpg, city/highway) four-cylinder engine available. Zoom out, and the picture is even bleaker. In a torrid U.S. market — a March seasonally adjusted rate of 16.3 million, near an all-time high — VWA sold 36,717 vehicles in March, having its head handed to it by, for example, Subaru (44,479). Eleven of VWA’s 13 models saw sales decline in the first three months of the year.At that rate, VW’s U.S. footprint is wildly, hilariously oversize, and excess capacity is one thing German auto executives positively hate.Now would be a good time to panic, but VW executives stationed in Herndon, Va., and Wolfsburg have committed to no more than what is known in the trades as a midmodel refresh, which sounds like something you would find on a fashion shoot. At the Geneva auto show in March, VWA chief Michael Horn — a German executive who in December succeeded Jon Browning, a Brit — assured reporters that the Passat was getting a face-lift for the 2016 model year, with new features, content and “fresh” styling.Well, may I say, chief, that is a leisurely timeline. Your house will have been burning a good four years by the time the fire brigade arrives.Now, why is any of this relevant to tire-kickers out cross shopping the Passat? Because, if you go to a car dealership and look at any car, you are looking at a moment in time, design-wise. Cars have life cycles and generations, and VW Group — as part of its decadelong quest for global domination — has embraced longer product life cycles to save money. In other words, the company changes its product less frequently than its competitors (a slower product “tempo” is the term of art). Not much, probably only 90-120 days in the case of Passat. But cumulatively, VW brand turns over its fleet more slowly than competitors, saving millions of euros in the process, at least on the front end.And that might be OK, if VW’s U.S. products had sufficient shelf life.Yeah, but . . . no.And it might be OK if the exterior design had legs. But VW’s design philosophy of late has favored a dignified, if perishable restraint (e.g., Passat). Meanwhile, the competition has produced some real lookers, including Fusion and Mazda6.In the U.S. midsize, midprice-sedan segment — absolutely frantic with innovation and competition — the Passat is suffering accelerated decrepitude, like the crew on that one Star Trek episode. And its five-year mission still has one year to go.The Passat’s general expiry can be illustrated on a number of fronts, but the new 1.8-liter gas-turbo, direct-injection in-line four is a good example. New for 2014 and late to the party, the 1.8T nonetheless works well, with adequate output (170 hp) and a free-revving, flexible character (184 pound feet of torque broadly spread between 1,500 and 4,750 rpm). But compared with Fusion’s 2.0-liter EcoBoost (231/270) or the Hyundai Sonata 2.0-liter (274/269) the VW tiny turbo feels one whole generation behind the curve.Are there any bright spots in the Passat lineup? Actually, one does jump out at me. The Passat is available with a 2.0-liter turbodiesel engine (31/43 mpg, city/highway when paired with a six-speed manual transmission). A diesel with a manual tranny is the ultimate auto-journo special.The maddening thing about the Passat is that most of its disadvantages are comparative. On its own, it is a comfortable, spacious sedan with very able, European handling. But when you start running the value-proposition numbers, comparing it with more rapidly evolving competitors, it quickly gets hopeless. I mean, look at the equipment list for, say, the Honda Accord EX-L with Navigation. The latter comes with a brace of driver-support systems the VW doesn’t have: forward collision alert, lane-departure warning, multiangle-rearview camera, LED taillamps and a lot more.The saving grace for VW is that modern car building is an iterative process. The tweaking goes on. VW is selling a sport version of the Passat, with a bin of go-fast cosmetics to help sales. And sometime next year a heavily revised Passat will arrive, incorporating as many lessons learned as the paymasters in Wolfsburg will allow.Until then VW’s quintessential Yankee Wagen will be residing in Valley Forge.More must-reads from MarketWatch:Lincoln MKZ isn’t a full mealRolls-Royce Wraith: Drive it like you own the placeNice curves at the New York auto show']"
04/27/2014,"[""Everyone who encounters bitcoin for the first time must grapple with how it works, and what it means.The former is relatively easy enough to learn, the latter however is something that everyone seems to have a different opinion on. 'Is bitcoin the next Internet?' seems to be the question behind news articles and passionate debates alike.Entrepreneur and bitcoin advocate Marc Andreessen has most visibly made comparisons between the two, while CNBC reported that many more venture capitalists thought bitcoin could be 'as big as the Internet'.Despite obvious buzz appeal, it’s a serious question with profound implications. How alike are bitcoin and the Internet, and what conclusions can we draw from the comparison?A natural metaphorWithin the world of monetary theory and finance, bitcoin is unprecedented. It is such a radical concept that many in the field are sceptical that the kind of decentralization bitcoin represents is even compatible with the modern economy.The Internet thus provides an obvious reference point for a technology that seems utterly similar in its decentralization, open-source code, state of development, and most importantly its potential to disrupt on a global scale.Indeed, if nothing else, the comparison can help effectively communicate the magnitude of bitcoin's technological achievement.Chris Ellis, the co-founder of feathercoin, captures this sentiment eloquently:“The first thing that humanity has built that humanity doesn’t understand, the largest experiment in anarchy that we have ever had.”That’s actually a quote from Eric Schmidt, talking about the Internet or the 'network of networks'. Every network it touches it liberates: already we’ve seen publishing, education, retail, and most famously music and film changed in ways we could not have imagined. Does bitcoin represent a similar moment for banking and finance?Given the fact that bitcoin cannot be centrally regulated, 'an experiment in anarchy' seems like an apt description. However for any bitcoin/Internet comparison to be truly useful and tell us where the technology can go from here, we need to compare characteristics in greater detail.Core differenceAlthough bitcoin and the Internet are both decentralized, they serve rather distinct purposes.The Internet evolved as the general purpose infrastructure for a limitless amount of applications and traffic, such as email. Bitcoin on the other hand has a very specific core purpose, a 'peer-to-peer electronic cash system' as described in the title of Satoshi's original whitepaper.Ultimately, most services built on top of bitcoin are meant to help it achieve its primary goal as a medium of exchange in one way or another. It exceeds this function by leaps and bounds – accomplishing what the current financial infrastructure is incapable of.However, as a general platform for new applications to run on bitcoin currently has severe limitations. Mastercoin, Counterparty, and others have attempted to build additional functionality on top of the bitcoin protocol with limited success.While the bitcoin block chain does contain properties that allow it to be used for third-party purposes, the resources are limited and have led to conflict in the past.Bitcoin simply isn’t designed to function as the flexible infrastructure for a wide range of applications like the Internet is.Block chain potentialHowever, the potential exists to use the fundamental technology underlying bitcoin, the decentralised block chain, to build numerous decentralized applications.Decentralized applications have been getting much media attention as of late as the true revolution behind bitcoin, and where we’ll see the most groundbreaking innovation.It opens the doors to decentralized email, domain names, smart contracts, and even Decentralized Autonomous Corporations. As David Jonston, Executive Director of BitAngels, put it:“[Decentralized applications or DAs] have the potential to become self-sustaining because they empower their stakeholders to invest in the development of the DA. Because of that, it is conceivable that DAs for payments, social networking, and cloud computing may one day surpass the valuation of multinational corporations like Western Union, Visa, Facebook, Google, and Amazon that are are currently active in the space.”Even Goldman Sachs remarked that the underlying technology behind bitcoin holds promise. Systems designed with the bitcoin blueprint can be extremely specific in nature, or instead provide a backbone that can support as many programs and applications as human creativity can generate – much like the Internet and web. Ethereum is currently being built on that very premise.Bitcoin itself however remains first and foremost a means of exchanging value. While its block chain technology holds the potential to create a new platform of permissionless innovation, this platform has, until recently, seemed destined to be divorced from the main bitcoin chain and functionality.Enter side chainsIn the context of the Internet comparison debate, new side chain proposals have great significance.If implemented into the bitcoin core code by the open-source community, it would enable anyone to create a side chain that can interact with the bitcoin block chain via two-way pegging. Coins can be moved from one chain to the other, allowing decentralized systems to be built that are interoperable with bitcoin.“Rather than the next Internet, bitcoin can become the next killer app for the Internet, much like the web before it”This means that new decentralized applications won’t require their own native unit of exchange and thus can avoid a new 'race for scarcity', as well as the extreme volatility that comes with a new, small market cap currency.Instead, such systems can utilize the rapidly maturing and more widely-accepted bitcoin as their native means of exchange and operation. In turn, the utility of such systems will directly add to the value and staying power of the bitcoin network.The implications of this are huge, as side chains will allow the general purpose infrastructure needed to allow the permissionless innovation the Internet and web are famous for. All tied in the end, to bitcoin.Side chains could be the last piece of the puzzle that links together the bitcoin currency, to the limitless possibilities its block chain technology holds.Brave new worldThis would make bitcoin not 'merely' a new e-cash system that far outperforms the capabilities of modern financial infrastructure.

The thing about Bitcoin is this though – you might not have that much freedom in spending it the same way as you would with cold, hard cash, since acceptance of Bitcoin has yet to become widespread. What if there was some way to use Bitcoin with a debit card? This is exactly what the Xapo debit card does – it is the first ever Bitcoin debit card in the world that has been linked directly to your Xapo Wallet. In a nutshell, you will now be able to make use of your Bitcoin savings via the Xapo debit card, in the same manner as you would with any other bank issued card.All transactions will be deducted from the wallet in real-time at the point of sales, which is a pretty nifty thing. This means you can now spend your Bitcoins in the same way like cash all over the world, directly from your Xapo Wallet. The Xapo debit card would mark a huge step forward in the development of the Bitcoin infrastructure, since this signals the very first time that customers are able to make use of Bitcoin at any online or offline merchant that accepts debit or credit cards.Since it is a whole lot easier and more convenient for users to pay with Bitcoins in real-time, all the while offering a seamless experience to merchants when it comes to accepting payment, it would be interesting to see just how many merchants would start to take up the Xapo debit card service. After all, the moment a customer makes a payment using Bitcoin, said merchant will be on the receiving end of the funds in their local currency.Product Page', 'When US authorities busted up the Silk Road and arrested alleged kingpin Ross Ulbricht last fall, it didn’t mean the end of online drugs-for-bitcoin markets. Alternative trading posts popped up immediately, and existing ones expanded to accommodate displaced buyers and sellers.However the sites have been rocked by thefts, more arrests and other troubles, leading some customers and even investigators to wax nostalgic about the ""original"" Dread Pirate Roberts, as Silk Road\'s founder called himself.One customer, who goes by the nickname \'hugs\', wrote in a message to CoinDesk:""[Chaos] is the word that I would choose to describe the landscape as it has morphed and changed after SilkRoad\'s seizure. Many sites have come and gone [...] many of them developing quite a following before being shut down or hacked. Buyers and vendors alike have been on a constant search for a stable market, one that will be around for longer than a couple of months.""One law enforcement source said the new markets are barely worth investigating at this point. He raised February\'s heist of thousands of bitcoins from Silk Road 2.0 as an example of bad management:“When the original Dread was running it, that never happened. It\'s not being run as well.”The law enforcement source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was involved in the original Silk Road investigation, but now is just keeping an eye on Silk Road 2.0 in the background.In fact, he’s not sure any law enforcement agencies are making Silk Road 2.0 or other online drug markets a priority.Silk Road 2.0\'s first admin styled himself as Dread Pirate Roberts, just as Ulbricht is alleged to have done, but he disappeared from the scene after three of the site\'s alleged moderators were arrested in December, and the site\'s new administrator calls himself \'Defcon\'.Users don\'t know who to trustOther sites to position themselves as Silk Road alternatives include the Sheep Marketplace, Black Market Reloaded, Utopia, Agora, Pandora, BlueSky and many others; some of these sites have shut down, others are still accessible on the deep web via the Tor browser.Of the current crop, \'hugs\' named Agora as the most stable, saying its administrators appear to be working diligently to gain user trust. But so far, no would-be mastermind seems to be able to fill the shoes of the original Dread Pirate Roberts.For one thing, many have failed to keep users’ bitcoins safe. In addition to the Silk Road 2.0 theft, another deep web trading post, Sheep Marketplace, reported a $6m heist and shut down in late 2013. In March, the market known as Pandora reported a theft of $250,000 in bitcoin, promised repayment, and stayed open.Because of the anonymous nature of these markets, it’s difficult for users to know if the sites were really hacked, or if the administrators just absconded with their bitcoins. The law enforcement source added:“Either the administrators don\'t have the level of expertise or the dedication to the web site that [the original DPR] did, or it could be that they\'re running a scam.”Users have tried following bitcoin movements through the block chain for clues, but that is probably a futile pursuit according to University of California-San Diego cryptographer Sarah Meiklejohn. She wrote in an email:""It would be difficult to verify just from block chain analysis if a theft were carried out by external thieves or by the owners of the service, since the movement of the bitcoins would presumably be the same either way. If you saw the bitcoins deposited into an exchange, and then asked that exchange who the real-world owner of that account was, you might learn something, but (1) that\'s not something that most users can do, and (2) operators of dark marketplaces are almost certainly not using their real names anyway. So basically, that doesn\'t seem possible.""This leads users to be a bit jumpy. When a market has a temporary outage, threads pop up on reddit speculating whether the site\'s organizers have taken the money and run.When Sheep Marketplace claimed it was robbed, users had already been speculating for days that a scam was in the works, since they had been unable to withdraw bitcoins from their accounts.The aftermath of hacksSilk Road 2.0 administrators appear to be making good on promises to reimburse users for losses following the alleged transaction malleability attack that hit the site in February.Defcon posted on the site\'s forums in early April that half the victims had been fully repaid, and that 100% had received at least a partial payment. He set 9th June as a rough target for full repayment.A number of Silk Road 2.0 users commented in the forum that they had indeed received payment, however, a few said they had received nothing as of early April. In turn, many users have not yet logged in to claim their reimbursement, according to the site\'s administrator.Other markets have handled things far differently. Sheep Marketplace\'s admins vanished after claiming theft. And the admin of Project Black Flag openly admitted pocketing users\' bitcoins when he shut down the market last fall.“[It] makes us realize once again how cool and proper Ross Ulbricht (allegedly) was. He could have fleeced people but instead he empowered people. Sad loss,” reddit user \'bitchrome\' commented in a discussion about the Sheep Marketplace shutdown.Another reddit user, \'JAMDIAM\', sounded fed up with post-Silk Road markets:“I don\'t eff with these markets anymore for two reasons: 1) They\'re clearly crawling with Feds. 2) The management of these sites will never match the original DPR (aka Ross Ulbricht).""Ross Ulbricht denies the FBI allegations and is currently in a New York detention centre awaiting trial.Improving securityTo prevent future thefts, Defcon removed Silk Road 2.0\'s centralized escrow system, writing on the market\'s forum that ""Centralization makes a market a huge target for attackers, and a huge target for dishonest administrators.""Instead, Defcon said the market will move to a multi-signature escrow system, in which a single person cannot move funds without agreement from one or more other signers. BlackBank, Cannabis Road, Cloud-Nine, DarkBay, Hydra, The Marketplace and Tor Bazaar are all listed as multisig markets on the darknetmarkets subreddit.Dark market shopper \'hugs\' clarified:""I think that within the next year we will see [multisignature escrow] become the standard for markets across the board. Vendors are tired of having their hard-earned money stolen or hacked, as are users. There are enough stressors in this business without the constant worry of dishonest or incompetent market admins to add to the list.""\'Hugs\' added: ""My hope is that multi-signature escrow will work to alleviate the fear of market scams. Although traditional escrow is currently much less complicated and more convenient for the average buyer, I think we\'ll soon begin to see multi-sig simplified and implemented in a way that even the most technologically deficient buyers [such as myself] can still take advantage of its benefits.""Of course, if the illegal marketplaces succeed in gaining customer trust – and, as a result, higher sales – they will also become a much larger target for law enforcement.“I don\'t know how much interest law enforcement has in Silk Road 2.0 right now. When they get up and start running hard, maybe they\'ll start taking a harder look at it,” said the Silk Road investigator.Pills Image via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The Xapo debit card would mark a huge step forward in the development of the Bitcoin infrastructure, since this signals the very first time that customers are able to make use of Bitcoin at any online or offline merchant that accepts debit or credit cards.Since it is a whole lot easier and more convenient for users to pay with Bitcoins in real-time, all the while offering a seamless experience to merchants when it comes to accepting payment, it would be interesting to see just how many merchants would start to take up the Xapo debit card service. After all, the moment a customer makes a payment using Bitcoin, said merchant will be on the receiving end of the funds in their local currency.Product Page', 'When US authorities busted up the Silk Road and arrested alleged kingpin Ross Ulbricht last fall, it didn’t mean the end of online drugs-for-bitcoin markets. Alternative trading posts popped up immediately, and existing ones expanded to accommodate displaced buyers and sellers.However the sites have been rocked by thefts, more arrests and other troubles, leading some customers and even investigators to wax nostalgic about the ""original"" Dread Pirate Roberts, as Silk Road\'s founder called himself.One customer, who goes by the nickname \'hugs\', wrote in a message to CoinDesk:""[Chaos] is the word that I would choose to describe the landscape as it has morphed and changed after SilkRoad\'s seizure. Many sites have come and gone [...] many of them developing quite a following before being shut down or hacked. Buyers and vendors alike have been on a constant search for a stable market, one that will be around for longer than a couple of months.""One law enforcement source said the new markets are barely worth investigating at this point. He raised February\'s heist of thousands of bitcoins from Silk Road 2.0 as an example of bad management:“When the original Dread was running it, that never happened. It\'s not being run as well.”The law enforcement source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was involved in the original Silk Road investigation, but now is just keeping an eye on Silk Road 2.0 in the background.In fact, he’s not sure any law enforcement agencies are making Silk Road 2.0 or other online drug markets a priority.Silk Road 2.0\'s first admin styled himself as Dread Pirate Roberts, just as Ulbricht is alleged to have done, but he disappeared from the scene after three of the site\'s alleged moderators were arrested in December, and the site\'s new administrator calls himself \'Defcon\'.Users don\'t know who to trustOther sites to position themselves as Silk Road alternatives include the Sheep Marketplace, Black Market Reloaded, Utopia, Agora, Pandora, BlueSky and many others; some of these sites have shut down, others are still accessible on the deep web via the Tor browser.Of the current crop, \'hugs\' named Agora as the most stable, saying its administrators appear to be working diligently to gain user trust. But so far, no would-be mastermind seems to be able to fill the shoes of the original Dread Pirate Roberts.For one thing, many have failed to keep users’ bitcoins safe. In addition to the Silk Road 2.0 theft, another deep web trading post, Sheep Marketplace, reported a $6m heist and shut down in late 2013. In March, the market known as Pandora reported a theft of $250,000 in bitcoin, promised repayment, and stayed open.Because of the anonymous nature of these markets, it’s difficult for users to know if the sites were really hacked, or if the administrators just absconded with their bitcoins. The law enforcement source added:“Either the administrators don\'t have the level of expertise or the dedication to the web site that [the original DPR] did, or it could be that they\'re running a scam.”Users have tried following bitcoin movements through the block chain for clues, but that is probably a futile pursuit according to University of California-San Diego cryptographer Sarah Meiklejohn. She wrote in an email:""It would be difficult to verify just from block chain analysis if a theft were carried out by external thieves or by the owners of the service, since the movement of the bitcoins would presumably be the same either way. If you saw the bitcoins deposited into an exchange, and then asked that exchange who the real-world owner of that account was, you might learn something, but (1) that\'s not something that most users can do, and (2) operators of dark marketplaces are almost certainly not using their real names anyway. So basically, that doesn\'t seem possible.""This leads users to be a bit jumpy. When a market has a temporary outage, threads pop up on reddit speculating whether the site\'s organizers have taken the money and run.When Sheep Marketplace claimed it was robbed, users had already been speculating for days that a scam was in the works, since they had been unable to withdraw bitcoins from their accounts.The aftermath of hacksSilk Road 2.0 administrators appear to be making good on promises to reimburse users for losses following the alleged transaction malleability attack that hit the site in February.Defcon posted on the site\'s forums in early April that half the victims had been fully repaid, and that 100% had received at least a partial payment. He set 9th June as a rough target for full repayment.A number of Silk Road 2.0 users commented in the forum that they had indeed received payment, however, a few said they had received nothing as of early April. In turn, many users have not yet logged in to claim their reimbursement, according to the site\'s administrator.Other markets have handled things far differently. Sheep Marketplace\'s admins vanished after claiming theft. And the admin of Project Black Flag openly admitted pocketing users\' bitcoins when he shut down the market last fall.“[It] makes us realize once again how cool and proper Ross Ulbricht (allegedly) was. He could have fleeced people but instead he empowered people. Sad loss,” reddit user \'bitchrome\' commented in a discussion about the Sheep Marketplace shutdown.Another reddit user, \'JAMDIAM\', sounded fed up with post-Silk Road markets:“I don\'t eff with these markets anymore for two reasons: 1) They\'re clearly crawling with Feds. 2) The management of these sites will never match the original DPR (aka Ross Ulbricht).""Ross Ulbricht denies the FBI allegations and is currently in a New York detention centre awaiting trial.Improving securityTo prevent future thefts, Defcon removed Silk Road 2.0\'s centralized escrow system, writing on the market\'s forum that ""Centralization makes a market a huge target for attackers, and a huge target for dishonest administrators.""Instead, Defcon said the market will move to a multi-signature escrow system, in which a single person cannot move funds without agreement from one or more other signers. BlackBank, Cannabis Road, Cloud-Nine, DarkBay, Hydra, The Marketplace and Tor Bazaar are all listed as multisig markets on the darknetmarkets subreddit.Dark market shopper \'hugs\' clarified:""I think that within the next year we will see [multisignature escrow] become the standard for markets across the board. Vendors are tired of having their hard-earned money stolen or hacked, as are users. There are enough stressors in this business without the constant worry of dishonest or incompetent market admins to add to the list.""\'Hugs\' added: ""My hope is that multi-signature escrow will work to alleviate the fear of market scams. Although traditional escrow is currently much less complicated and more convenient for the average buyer, I think we\'ll soon begin to see multi-sig simplified and implemented in a way that even the most technologically deficient buyers [such as myself] can still take advantage of its benefits.""Of course, if the illegal marketplaces succeed in gaining customer trust – and, as a result, higher sales – they will also become a much larger target for law enforcement.“I don\'t know how much interest law enforcement has in Silk Road 2.0 right now. When they get up and start running hard, maybe they\'ll start taking a harder look at it,” said the Silk Road investigator.Pills Image via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

If you haven’t, it’s what’s referred to as an “altcoin”, or alternative digital currency. And while each dogecoin isn’t as valuable as a bitcoin, the currency has an awesome, friendly community behind it.Which is why they decided to start a fundraiser to sponsor a NASCAR race car driver, Josh Wise, at the Talladega Superspeedway after a dogecoin user, Denis Pavel, noticed Wise’s car was unsponsored.The community managed to raise 60 million doge (or $55,000) to make it happen, and by golly, it’s happened. In less than two weeks, too.On the Dogecoin subreddit, an image of the finished car was submitted today, and it’s looking quite lovely.Look’s like she’s ready to race full-force at Talladega on May 4th. Will you watch the race?', 'Существует множество причин малой распространённости криптовалюты Bitcoin, однако, несомненно, главная из них — сложность расчётов в реальной жизни. Компания Xapo, которая уже предлагает онлайн-кошельки Bitcoin, желая улучшить положение дел в данной сфере, объявила о выпуске платёжных карт, привязанных к аккаунту кошелька Bitcoin.На текущий момент потратить Bitcoin можно двумя способами: найти продавца интересующих пользователя товаров, принимающего к оплате криптовалюту либо воспользоваться специализированными обменными сервисами. Иногда бывает доступен вариант с QR-кодом, что позволяет незначительно сократить временные затраты, однако работа с традиционным «пластиком» характеризуется большим уровнем комфорта и мгновенным исполнением. Благодаря карте от Xapo появится ещё один способ.Фактически, Xapo возлагает на себя все операции по обмену: проверка баланса Bitcoin, продажа на бирже Bitstamp, конвертация в необходимую валюту, расчёт с продавцом. Пользователю остаётся лишь передать карту и оплатить покупку через терминал, поддерживающий платёжные системы VISA или MasterCard.Единственная потенциальная трудность, которую Xapo не в состоянии решить — нестабильность курса Bitcoin. Может возникнуть ситуация, когда из-за колебания курса баланс средств окажется недостаточным для совершения покупки. Впрочем, владельцы кошельков Bitcoin наверняка знакомы с данной проблемой.Карта будет доступна широкой общественности в ближайшее время, пока только на территории США. Стоимость выпуска составляет $15.']"

06/14/2014,"[""As bitcoin becomes more popular and attracts mainstream users, scammers are resorting to tried-and-tested tricks like phishing emails and imitation websites to steal your funds.Follow these tips to keep yours safe.1) Don’t be greedyPhishing emails targeted at bitcoin users have so far come in a variety of flavours, the most blatant of which involves a person ostensibly sending you their wallet backup file and private key and asking you to send their bitcoin to another wallet address.The bait here is that you’ll take the money and run. But as Imgur user GreenFox detailed in January, the wallet file actually contains an executable program (.exe) disguised as a text file, that will make off with your coins should you accidentally install it.In short, don't let your greed get the better of you.2) Don't click links in unsolicited emailsThis applies to any of the more popular bitcoin services. At their most effective, phishing emails imitate the branding, language and function of emails from well-known and trusted companies.In the case of Blockchain fakes, the phishing emails have included everything from supposed failed transaction notifications to unauthorized login attempts.Instead of appealing to your greed, these types of emails co-opt your concerns about security. And rather than downloading malicious software, these emails will more likely ask you to visit a website to enter your password, but both are possible.There are two things you can do to double check that an email is legitimate.Firstly, look at the actual email address (not the screenname) that the email has come from. If it isn’t from precisely the website it claims to be from, that’s a big red warning flag.Secondly, don’t blindly click web addresses. Hover over the link with your cursor and the web browser will show you the real URL in the bottom left hand corner of your screen on the 'status bar'. Note that, in some browsers, Safari, for example, this grey strip may be hidden. Go to View > Show Status Bar to reveal it.However, as DeathAndTaxes suggests on BitcoinTalk, “A good rule of thumb is to simply never click on links in emails for site which may be important.”3) Beware Google advertsNot a phishing email exactly, but the use of fake Google adverts to direct people away from legitimate bitcoin services towards fake imitation sites has been a recent concern of the bitcoin community.The scammers simply buy an advert on Google AdWords that claims to be for Blockchain or BTC-e, two sites affected by such scams, but actually directs to a replica website. The scammers can then steal people’s private information when they attempt to sign in or register on the fake website.Firstly, if you spot a fake advert, report it immediately to Google. The longer fake adverts stay up, the more likely it is someone will fall prey to them. You can report a specific advert here and you can report a scam website here.Secondly, as a general rule, check a website’s URL in the browser before inputting any data. As user @juanjblog pointed out in a recent tweet, it’s pretty hard to see that the recent fake Blockchain.info site pictured above isn’t the real deal.Stay vigilantHopefully, after reading the above, you are now a little less likely to have your bitcoin stolen.However, keeping your bitcoin secure requires constant vigilance and a bit more effort than simply not clicking links on emails or dodgy ads. Try starting with CoinDesk's primer on paper wallets, one of the most secure ways of safely storing bitcoin.If you must keep coins online, two-factor authorisation and multi-signature wallets are far more secure than those with a single password.Fisherman image via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Il futuro potrebbe spazzarvi via.Che l\'economia globale stia diventando sempre più virtuale è ormai chiaro da tempo. Ma stanno emergendo segnali di una svolta nel mondo degli scambi economico-finanziari che potrebbe dimostrarsi dirompente quanto quella di Facebook nelle relazioni interpersonali. E i primi a pagarne le conseguenze sarebbero proprio gli intermediari finanziari.A fare da battistrada è Bitcoin, la più diffusa moneta virtuale, o criptovaluta, oggi esistente. Pur non avendo la copertura, né tantomeno la garanzia, di uno Stato, in cinque anni si è affermata come strumento valutario usato in tutto il mondo. È diventata una realtà economica da oltre 5,5 miliardi di dollari. E dal 26 giugno avrà la sua prima presenza fisica in Italia, con l\'istallazione di un ""bancomat Bitcoin"" alla Stazione Termini di Roma.Cameron e Tyler Winklevoss, i gemelli di Harvard che hanno accusato Mark Zuckerberg di aver rubato idea e codici del social network universitario precursore di Facebook, sono convinti che il potenziale di Bitcoin sia superiore a quello del colosso di Zuckerberg. Tant\'è che hanno investito circa 50 milioni di dollari.Ma Bitcoin è solo l\'inizio. Dalla valuta senza Stato, si stanno creando le basi per arrivare a una finanza senza banche. E in ultima battuta addirittura a un\'economia che non necessita intermediari. Il progetto più ambizioso è quello di Vitalik Butarin, un ventenne canadese di origine russa che con altre sette ""visionari"" ha fondato Ethereum, da lui definita ""il lego della finanza futura"". Il suo piano è di creare da zero un meccanismo di scritture contabili criptate e condivise in modo decentralizzato - i cosiddetti ""blockchain ledger"" - come quello sul quale l\'anonimo inventore di Bitcoin ha basato la sua valuta virtuale.""Nel 2009, quando parlavo di Bitcoin la gente riteneva che fosse un\' idea folle, che non avrebbe funzionato mai. Ma nel giro di pochi anni è stata accettata. Con progetti quali quello di Ethereum i tempi potrebbero essere persino più brevi. Perché hanno il vantaggio di nascere sulle fondamenta già accettate di Bitcoin,"" dice a Il Sole 24 Ore Primavera De Filippi, giovane ricercatrice italo-francese del Berkman Center for Internet and Society dell\'Università di Harvard.I fondatori di Ethereum intendono applicare il meccanismo del blockchain a qualsiasi settore dell\'economia - e della società - in cui siano utilizzabili contratti ""intelligenti"". ""Parliamo di smart contract auto-ottemperanti"", spiega De Filippi. ""L\'idea di fondo è che il contratto e il suo codice siano la stessa cosa, e quindi che il contratto sia prima definito e poi automaticamente eseguito dal codice. Un\'analogia può essere quella con un distributore automatico: basta inserire la cifra stabilita perché la macchina consegni il prodotto desiderato. Non occorre fidarsi delle intenzioni della macchina, né la macchina deve fidarsi di quelle del cliente. La transazione è predeterminata. Nel caso dei contratti intelligenti l\'interazione è determinata dal codice e ogni transazione viene registrata nei libri contabili criptati decentralizzati e distribuiti a tutti coloro che hanno accettato regole e procedure del protocollo di Ethereum"". In questo modo si potranno creare rapporti di scambio di ogni genere del tutto autonomi, o come si dice in gergo ""disintermediati"", e privi delle garanzie fornite da autorità terze, come una banca, un\'azienda o uno Stato. Come è appunto il caso di Bitcoin.""L\'idea è di evitare intermediazioni gestite da esseri umani, quindi suscettibili ad abusi o corruzione, e passare a un sistema decentralizzato e autogovernato basato su algoritmi con codici aperti a tutti e perciò del tutto trasparenti"", aggiunge De Filippi.Da Toronto e Zurigo, dove sono basati, i pionieri Ethereum puntano a lanciare la prima versione della loro piattaforma entro la fine del 2014. ""L\'obiettivo è di creare un sistema aperto di blockchain che possa essere utilizzato da chiunque per creare nuovi modelli di business o nuove forme di partecipazione sociale senza controllo centralizzato"", ci spiega Joseph Lubin, che a 49 anni è il più anziano degli otto fondatori di Ethereum, e certamente quello con maggiore esperienza, avendo lavorato in società di software, hedge fund e persino a Goldman Sachs.Quella di Ethereum è una sfida tecnologicamente difficile, perché intende costruire un nuovo sistema di blockchain anziché utilizzare quello già testato di Bitcoin. E potrebbe non riuscire.Meno ambiziosi e ritenuti quindi più credibili sono svariati altri progetti di servizi finanziari e commerciali basati sull\'utilizzo di criptovalute quale Bitcoin. Come quello di Circle, una startup di Boston che sta per lanciare una serie di prodotti finanziari digitali intesi a favorire l\'uso di Bitcoin tra il grande pubblico che ha già raccolto 26 milioni di dollari di venture capital.Quali delle tante iniziative del settore riuscirà ad affermarsi è difficile prevederlo anche per un\'esperta come Primavera De Filippi. Ma a suo giudizio non c\'è dubbio che il trend sia inarrestabile.Clicca per CondividereLeggi e scrivi Commenta la notizia', 'The US Marshals have announced they’ll be auctioning nearly 30,000 Bitcoins seized from legal actions taken against Silk Road 1.0. The auction will sell off nine blocks of 3,000 BTC (referred to as “A” blocks) and one block of 2,656.51 coins. At current market price ($587 as of this writing) that’s a nice $17.4 million worth of Bitcoins. BTC price has been volatile today, possibly in response to the announcement, as a new block of currency hitting the market could drive prices downward. Before this point, BTC prices had been fairly stable in the mid $600 range.There have been questions raised about whether or not these coins are actually the property of Ross William Ulbricht (the supposed Dread Pirate Roberts), but the Marshals’ auction statement makes it clear that these coins are not the stated property of Ulbright. In fact, the Dread Pirate was quick to disassociate himself with these wallets, as owning them might actually be used as further proof that he occupied that role and therefore aid in his criminal conviction.The auction isn’t open to just anyone — those interested in ordering a block of coins must send a $200,000 deposit to demonstrate an ability to pay for the coins. If you win, your $200,000 deposit is used toward the purchase price. If you lose, the funds are returned.Asset forfeitureOne topic that’s come up is the question of whether or not the government has the right to sell these BTC in an auction, or if the forfeiture laws are unfair to the coin’s original owners. While there have been some unquestionably dubious cases where asset forfeiture was used unjustly in the United States, in this case, no one has stepped forward to claim the original coins (or some portion of them).Given the nature of what the Silk Road dealt in, it’s incredibly unlikely that any of the funds in question were used to purchase Haribo gummy bears or actual legal merchandise, which means the government is well within its rights to sell the BTC and recover the proceeds. The coins belonging to Ulbricht, however, will not be sold at this point — as identified personal property, their disposition will hinge on whether or not he’s found innocent or guilty at trial. Meanwhile, the Silk Road itself has apparently reformed to some degree under a new Dread Pirate Roberts and is again doing business — though whether it has reached its original size and scale is still unknown.', 'Rory MacDonald is not misunderstood by fans. He isn’t understood at all. And that’s the way he prefers it.The UFC welterweight contender, who meets Tyron Woodley at UFC 174 on Saturday night, speaks quietly with a conspicuous lack of emotion. Sometimes MacDonald’s words can be intense, but his expression never changes. Those mannerisms and his preppy fashion sense have caused him to be dubbed by some as the ""Canadian Psycho,"" a take on Christian Bale’s serial-killer character in ""American Psycho.""So who exactly is the 24-year-old from Vancouver who happens one of the best 170-pound fighters in world? Is he as cold and emotionless as he appears in interviews?Article continues below ...Probably not. But MacDonald is not about to let us in. He isn’t like Anderson Silva, who messes around with the media as part of his mystique. There’s no attempt at an aura here. MacDonald just really isn’t comfortable putting himself out there to the public.""It’s nothing that I desire,"" he said. ""I just like fighting and martial arts. … It’s just my personality. I’m not interested in it. It’s like me asking you, why don’t you go to bullfighting events every weekend?""It’s just my personality. I’m not interested in it. -Rory MacDonald on media exposureIt took about 10 minutes of talking to him on the phone for him to determine that I’m not a bullfighting enthusiast. Maybe it was the New York accent. Or maybe MacDonald is just a cerebral, perceptive guy.Not maybe. He is.MacDonald (16-2) is the kind of person who finds an interest and then completely immerses himself in it. His latest ""obsession,"" as he calls it, is Bitcoin, the up-and-coming, yet controversial digital currency. MacDonald told me he just started a Bitcoin wallet this week. I almost got him to laugh when I asked him if he requested the UFC to pay him in it. Almost.""It’s a decentralized currency,"" MacDonald. ""It’s new to me.

Just like every other MMA fighter, right?', ""Victor Mallet in Dharamsala, India JUNE 15, 2014 21 The newly arrived refugee in his late twenties with the maroon robes, shaven head and pink cheeks of a high-altitude Buddhist monk does not hesitate when asked to talk about life in his native Tibet. “It is like a dog waiting for a cat,” he says of the Chinese forces who have occupied a park near the monastery where he had studied and prayed for his entire adult life. “They are ready to jump on us.” The monk, who asks to remain anonymous to protect his family, served time in jail for his part in the 2008 Tibetan protests – crushed by China – against what locals say is the destruction of their culture, language and natural resources and their own economic marginalisation at the hands of Han Chinese migrants. He comes from Ngaba, a town in what is now Sichuan province that is famous among Tibetan exiles: it is where dozens of Tibetans have set themselves ablaze and died in desperate “self-immolations” designed to bring their homeland’s plight to the attention of a largely indifferent world. The monk, however, chose not to kill himself as 130 fellow Tibetans have attempted in the past five years, 112 successfully. Nor did he want to stay and endure police interrogations and the Orwellian “patriotic education” sessions of the “Democratic Management Committees” installed by China to control Tibetan monasteries. Instead he escaped, paying Rmb12,000 ($1,930) to a guide who sent him via Lhasa and Nepal to Dharamsala in northern India. He arrived here this month to fulfil the Tibetan dream of paying homage to the Dalai Lama, the pacifist spiritual leader who is demonised by Beijing as a separatist but who says he only seeks real autonomy for Tibet within China. “I saw there was no way to live under the Chinese,” the young monk says at the refugee reception centre on the banks of a stream in the Himalayan foothills that was constructed with US aid. “More and more people my age feel like leaving Tibet.” Fewer and fewer, however, can actually escape. By setting up roadblocks around Lhasa, increasing border security and pressing Nepal to turn away Tibetans, China has reduced the flow of refugees to a trickle. Before the 2008 uprising, 2,000-3,000 Tibetans left annually; last year only 300 made it across. The young monk is one of only four people staying in a centre built for 500. Another is Golog Jigme, a 43-year-old monk who helped make a film about Tibet called Leaving Fear Behind and who escaped from a police station in 2012 when he heard that the security services were planning to kill him with a bogus medical procedure. He hid in the mountains and forests for a year and a half before paying Rmb15,000 to be extracted across the border via a route he would not disclose. “The situation in Tibet is urgent,” he says, minutes after hearing the Dalai Lama teaching a crowd of thousands at a schooling and religious centre known as the Tibet Children’s Village. “We cannot live as humans. There is no freedom to express ourselves, there is no freedom to move\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009There are huge numbers of Han Chinese coming into Tibet at the moment. Nomads are forced to end their traditional way of life. The aim of the Chinese action is to dilute the Tibetan identity and the Tibetan people.” The Chinese Communist leadership, whose forces invaded Tibet in 1950, has sought to exclude most journalists and other independent observers from the region for the past decade, prompting some critics to regard Chinese-run Tibet as more closed and isolated than North Korea. Golog Jigme: 'We cannot live as humans' Such tales as do emerge paint China in a brutal light. Sonam Rabga – a monk who left Tibet in 1992 via the Mount Everest base camp in Nepal and lived peacefully at a monastery in southern India for 20 years – went back two years ago to see his elderly mother in a remote village. After three days at home he left the village and was arrested on the road within half an hour. He was badly beaten and tortured for three weeks by interrogators obsessed with his links to the Dalai Lama, although he insists he has no interest in politics, before being dumped at the Nepal border and told never to return. Both his kidneys have failed, he needs dialysis three times a week and is waiting for a transplant. “Desperation” is the word used to describe the plight of 6m Tibetans by Lobsang Sangay, the Harvard law scholar elected to succeed the Dalai Lama as the nation’s political leader in exile. Perhaps the only glimmer of hope comes from the world’s dawning awareness of China’s aggressive pursuit of other territorial claims in India and the South China Sea, and of the contrast between Tibetan pacifism and the knife and bomb attacks on Chinese targets by Uighur Muslim separatists from Xinjiang, which borders Tibet. Sonam Rabga, a monk who was beaten and tortured after returning to Tibet two years ago “So they are all asking what kind of country, what kind of global power is China going to be,” says Mr Sangay in an interview. “The Tibetan narrative is very important\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009First they [the Chinese] have friendship, then they make some starting claims, and then, inch by inch, and after some time, a full-blown occupation\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I remember some Asian leaders saying – it is a quote, actually – ‘we don’t want to be like Tibet’.” Mr Sangay warns of the risk of “unfortunate incidents” if Chinese repression continues, while other Tibetan leaders talk of the intense passion of the monks and farmers who anoint themselves with petrol and set themselves on fire. But few talk of resorting to violence against the Chinese. The newly arrived young monk at first does not even understand the question when asked about violent resistance. “The best way is not fighting back,” he says finally, recalling the torture and suffering prompted by the 2008 uprising. “We must just keep our identity and language quietly and wait for the Chinese to be brought round.”""]","[""As bitcoin becomes more popular and attracts mainstream users, scammers are resorting to tried-and-tested tricks like phishing emails and imitation websites to steal your funds.Follow these tips to keep yours safe.1) Don’t be greedyPhishing emails targeted at bitcoin users have so far come in a variety of flavours, the most blatant of which involves a person ostensibly sending you their wallet backup file and private key and asking you to send their bitcoin to another wallet address.The bait here is that you’ll take the money and run. But as Imgur user GreenFox detailed in January, the wallet file actually contains an executable program (.exe) disguised as a text file, that will make off with your coins should you accidentally install it.In short, don't let your greed get the better of you.2) Don't click links in unsolicited emailsThis applies to any of the more popular bitcoin services. At their most effective, phishing emails imitate the branding, language and function of emails from well-known and trusted companies.In the case of Blockchain fakes, the phishing emails have included everything from supposed failed transaction notifications to unauthorized login attempts.Instead of appealing to your greed, these types of emails co-opt your concerns about security. And rather than downloading malicious software, these emails will more likely ask you to visit a website to enter your password, but both are possible.There are two things you can do to double check that an email is legitimate.Firstly, look at the actual email address (not the screenname) that the email has come from. If it isn’t from precisely the website it claims to be from, that’s a big red warning flag.Secondly, don’t blindly click web addresses. Hover over the link with your cursor and the web browser will show you the real URL in the bottom left hand corner of your screen on the 'status bar'. Note that, in some browsers, Safari, for example, this grey strip may be hidden. Go to View > Show Status Bar to reveal it.However, as DeathAndTaxes suggests on BitcoinTalk, “A good rule of thumb is to simply never click on links in emails for site which may be important.”3) Beware Google advertsNot a phishing email exactly, but the use of fake Google adverts to direct people away from legitimate bitcoin services towards fake imitation sites has been a recent concern of the bitcoin community.The scammers simply buy an advert on Google AdWords that claims to be for Blockchain or BTC-e, two sites affected by such scams, but actually directs to a replica website. The scammers can then steal people’s private information when they attempt to sign in or register on the fake website.Firstly, if you spot a fake advert, report it immediately to Google. The longer fake adverts stay up, the more likely it is someone will fall prey to them. You can report a specific advert here and you can report a scam website here.Secondly, as a general rule, check a website’s URL in the browser before inputting any data. As user @juanjblog pointed out in a recent tweet, it’s pretty hard to see that the recent fake Blockchain.info site pictured above isn’t the real deal.Stay vigilantHopefully, after reading the above, you are now a little less likely to have your bitcoin stolen.However, keeping your bitcoin secure requires constant vigilance and a bit more effort than simply not clicking links on emails or dodgy ads. Try starting with CoinDesk's primer on paper wallets, one of the most secure ways of safely storing bitcoin.If you must keep coins online, two-factor authorisation and multi-signature wallets are far more secure than those with a single password.Fisherman image via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Il futuro potrebbe spazzarvi via.Che l\'economia globale stia diventando sempre più virtuale è ormai chiaro da tempo. Ma stanno emergendo segnali di una svolta nel mondo degli scambi economico-finanziari che potrebbe dimostrarsi dirompente quanto quella di Facebook nelle relazioni interpersonali. E i primi a pagarne le conseguenze sarebbero proprio gli intermediari finanziari.A fare da battistrada è Bitcoin, la più diffusa moneta virtuale, o criptovaluta, oggi esistente. Pur non avendo la copertura, né tantomeno la garanzia, di uno Stato, in cinque anni si è affermata come strumento valutario usato in tutto il mondo. È diventata una realtà economica da oltre 5,5 miliardi di dollari. E dal 26 giugno avrà la sua prima presenza fisica in Italia, con l\'istallazione di un ""bancomat Bitcoin"" alla Stazione Termini di Roma.Cameron e Tyler Winklevoss, i gemelli di Harvard che hanno accusato Mark Zuckerberg di aver rubato idea e codici del social network universitario precursore di Facebook, sono convinti che il potenziale di Bitcoin sia superiore a quello del colosso di Zuckerberg. Tant\'è che hanno investito circa 50 milioni di dollari.Ma Bitcoin è solo l\'inizio. Dalla valuta senza Stato, si stanno creando le basi per arrivare a una finanza senza banche. E in ultima battuta addirittura a un\'economia che non necessita intermediari. Il progetto più ambizioso è quello di Vitalik Butarin, un ventenne canadese di origine russa che con altre sette ""visionari"" ha fondato Ethereum, da lui definita ""il lego della finanza futura"". Il suo piano è di creare da zero un meccanismo di scritture contabili criptate e condivise in modo decentralizzato - i cosiddetti ""blockchain ledger"" - come quello sul quale l\'anonimo inventore di Bitcoin ha basato la sua valuta virtuale.""Nel 2009, quando parlavo di Bitcoin la gente riteneva che fosse un\' idea folle, che non avrebbe funzionato mai. Ma nel giro di pochi anni è stata accettata. Con progetti quali quello di Ethereum i tempi potrebbero essere persino più brevi. Perché hanno il vantaggio di nascere sulle fondamenta già accettate di Bitcoin,"" dice a Il Sole 24 Ore Primavera De Filippi, giovane ricercatrice italo-francese del Berkman Center for Internet and Society dell\'Università di Harvard.I fondatori di Ethereum intendono applicare il meccanismo del blockchain a qualsiasi settore dell\'economia - e della società - in cui siano utilizzabili contratti ""intelligenti"". ""Parliamo di smart contract auto-ottemperanti"", spiega De Filippi. ""L\'idea di fondo è che il contratto e il suo codice siano la stessa cosa, e quindi che il contratto sia prima definito e poi automaticamente eseguito dal codice. Un\'analogia può essere quella con un distributore automatico: basta inserire la cifra stabilita perché la macchina consegni il prodotto desiderato. Non occorre fidarsi delle intenzioni della macchina, né la macchina deve fidarsi di quelle del cliente. La transazione è predeterminata. Nel caso dei contratti intelligenti l\'interazione è determinata dal codice e ogni transazione viene registrata nei libri contabili criptati decentralizzati e distribuiti a tutti coloro che hanno accettato regole e procedure del protocollo di Ethereum"". In questo modo si potranno creare rapporti di scambio di ogni genere del tutto autonomi, o come si dice in gergo ""disintermediati"", e privi delle garanzie fornite da autorità terze, come una banca, un\'azienda o uno Stato. Come è appunto il caso di Bitcoin.""L\'idea è di evitare intermediazioni gestite da esseri umani, quindi suscettibili ad abusi o corruzione, e passare a un sistema decentralizzato e autogovernato basato su algoritmi con codici aperti a tutti e perciò del tutto trasparenti"", aggiunge De Filippi.Da Toronto e Zurigo, dove sono basati, i pionieri Ethereum puntano a lanciare la prima versione della loro piattaforma entro la fine del 2014. ""L\'obiettivo è di creare un sistema aperto di blockchain che possa essere utilizzato da chiunque per creare nuovi modelli di business o nuove forme di partecipazione sociale senza controllo centralizzato"", ci spiega Joseph Lubin, che a 49 anni è il più anziano degli otto fondatori di Ethereum, e certamente quello con maggiore esperienza, avendo lavorato in società di software, hedge fund e persino a Goldman Sachs.Quella di Ethereum è una sfida tecnologicamente difficile, perché intende costruire un nuovo sistema di blockchain anziché utilizzare quello già testato di Bitcoin. E potrebbe non riuscire.Meno ambiziosi e ritenuti quindi più credibili sono svariati altri progetti di servizi finanziari e commerciali basati sull\'utilizzo di criptovalute quale Bitcoin. Come quello di Circle, una startup di Boston che sta per lanciare una serie di prodotti finanziari digitali intesi a favorire l\'uso di Bitcoin tra il grande pubblico che ha già raccolto 26 milioni di dollari di venture capital.Quali delle tante iniziative del settore riuscirà ad affermarsi è difficile prevederlo anche per un\'esperta come Primavera De Filippi. Ma a suo giudizio non c\'è dubbio che il trend sia inarrestabile.Clicca per CondividereLeggi e scrivi Commenta la notizia', 'The US Marshals have announced they’ll be auctioning nearly 30,000 Bitcoins seized from legal actions taken against Silk Road 1.0. The auction will sell off nine blocks of 3,000 BTC (referred to as “A” blocks) and one block of 2,656.51 coins. At current market price ($587 as of this writing) that’s a nice $17.4 million worth of Bitcoins. BTC price has been volatile today, possibly in response to the announcement, as a new block of currency hitting the market could drive prices downward. Before this point, BTC prices had been fairly stable in the mid $600 range.There have been questions raised about whether or not these coins are actually the property of Ross William Ulbricht (the supposed Dread Pirate Roberts), but the Marshals’ auction statement makes it clear that these coins are not the stated property of Ulbright. In fact, the Dread Pirate was quick to disassociate himself with these wallets, as owning them might actually be used as further proof that he occupied that role and therefore aid in his criminal conviction.The auction isn’t open to just anyone — those interested in ordering a block of coins must send a $200,000 deposit to demonstrate an ability to pay for the coins. If you win, your $200,000 deposit is used toward the purchase price. If you lose, the funds are returned.Asset forfeitureOne topic that’s come up is the question of whether or not the government has the right to sell these BTC in an auction, or if the forfeiture laws are unfair to the coin’s original owners. While there have been some unquestionably dubious cases where asset forfeiture was used unjustly in the United States, in this case, no one has stepped forward to claim the original coins (or some portion of them).Given the nature of what the Silk Road dealt in, it’s incredibly unlikely that any of the funds in question were used to purchase Haribo gummy bears or actual legal merchandise, which means the government is well within its rights to sell the BTC and recover the proceeds. The coins belonging to Ulbricht, however, will not be sold at this point — as identified personal property, their disposition will hinge on whether or not he’s found innocent or guilty at trial. Meanwhile, the Silk Road itself has apparently reformed to some degree under a new Dread Pirate Roberts and is again doing business — though whether it has reached its original size and scale is still unknown.', 'Rory MacDonald is not misunderstood by fans.

06/22/2014,"['The Philippines welcomes its first Bitcoin ATM. Brought by Satoshi Citadel Industries and Bitmarket.ph, the machine will be ordered from Skyhook and will cost $US 999. ATMs are no longer exciting news, yet this one is a lot smaller in size and it will speak to the success of Bitcoins on a global scale. The ATM will appeal to a wealth of people and cultures with money to trade and transactions to process.A better understanding of Project SkyhookWhat is Skyhook? Skyhook is an open-source Bitcoin ATM. Selling Bitcoins was once difficult, and many people were tired of depending on exchanges and centralized banks to buy Bitcoins. Skyhook changed everything. The company developed a tiny and secure machine everyone can use to exchange Bitcoins.It comes with a hefty security mounting plate and a password-on-boot options. It someone steals it, you have nothing to worry as your Bitcoins will be safe. The ATM accepts Australian, US, and Canadian dollars, as well as Argentinean Pesos, Yuan, Euros, and numerous other currencies.Easy to set up, Skyhook comes with a detailed guide you should use to get started. Buyers will require a Wi-Fi or wired internet connection, a power cable, and Bitcoins to sell. The touch-screen graphical interface of Skyhook will ease your job to buy Bitcoins and make use of the QR code for wallet address recognition.Skyhook sets Bitcoin prices automatically using major exchanges. Afterwards, it adds a minimum price protection so that you can get paid for using Bitcoins. The ATM machine is excellent for vendors, storefronts, bars, meet-ups, and merchants. Set your rate and start trading.Bitcoin, a global phenomenon now available in compact size in the PhilippinesUnlike the other two popular Bitcoin machines, Lamassu and Robocoin, Skyhook is a lot smaller, and of course, less expensive. Owned by a Filipino company known as Bitmarket.ph, locals will finally be able to trade Bitcoins with Philippine pesos and not have to worry about exchange rates. To use Bitmarket.ph all you have to do is activate and access your account. Next, type your transaction\'s details (details of the buyer and item for sale). Enter your selling price and exchange it in Bitcoins immediately.Generate a QR code and use the code to share it with clients. Bitmarket additionally offers cash settlements where you can convert Bitcoins into Philippine pesos daily. Bitcoins provide fast, real time transactions to customers. Trading Bitcoins keeps people away from chargebacks, bank fees, and commissions. Unlike other forms of exchange, Bitcoins provide transparency where you can track each one of your transactions in real time. Vendors accepting Bitcoins are essentially adding value to their business by gaining a competitive advantage as a first adopter and cutting costs.Now that the Philippines is finally welcoming its first Bitcoin ATM, people will ""dispense Bitcoins for Pesos on the spot in a matter of seconds at competitive and fair rates.”', 'Local news reports are informing the general public that Bolivia’s central bank – El Banco Central de Bolivia – has officially announced that it has banned any currency or coins that are not regulated by the government. This includes bitcoin as well as several other virtual currencies, including feathercoin, namecoin, peercoin, primecoin and Quark.The newest policy was actually made earlier last month but it has only since made the headlines in the South American nation, including in the Spanish news publication the PanAm Post. What’s interesting is that this is the first and only announcement relating to the peer-to-peer decentralized virtual currency made by the central bank.The purpose of the ban is protect the bolivaro and to protect consumers and investors from doling out money into these kinds of currencies that they believe are high risk, unsafe and pose a threat to the national currency.According to a translation of the article, the central bank noted that citizens are banned from denominating prices in any type of currency that is not officially recognized, regulated or approved by government agencies.Other countries have considered or believed to have been in the midst of implementing prohibitive measures against bitcoins and other digital currencies. China, Russia and Thailand had imposed restrictive controls on bitcoin, which many had believed would lead to a nationwide ban. Instead, the nations have backtracked on this and even one People’s Bank of China official confirmed it would not ban bitcoin.Sebastian Serrano, CEO of Argentina bitcoin merchant processor BitPagos, told CoinDesk that this won’t really hinder bitcoin operations. Nevertheless, in a country that suffers from massive bouts of poverty, this is really a regressive stance.“The news from Bolivia is very sad, especially considering it is one of the poorest countries in Latin America,” said Serrano. “Hopefully, Bolivia will revert its decision in the future as bitcoin continues to prosper in the rest of the world.”This hasn’t necessarily affected the price of bitcoin as it remains close to the $600 mark.', 'V úterý 17. června se v Národní technické knihovně v pražských Dejvicích konala konference Bitcoin a další kryptoměny, která se zabývala současností a budoucností virtuálních měn. Sešli se na ní těžaři, vývojáři, provozovatelé burz, ale i obchodníci a zprostředkovatelé platebních bran. Nejen Blockchainem živ je bitcoin a plně funkční měna vyžaduje celý ekosystém, který právě kolem bitcoinu teprve vzniká.Hynek Horák: peníze potřebují (r)evoluciV úvodní přednášce se Hynek Horák zabýval změnami, které ve společnosti proběhly za poslední desetiletí. Prakticky všechny stránky lidského života prošly zásadní přeměnou, kromě jediné. Komunikace, média, způsob práce, nakupování i zábava prošly velkou změnou. Jen peníze zůstaly stále stejné, řekl Horák. Právě nové digitální měny by mohly být onou revolucí, která peníze zmodernizuje a zjednoduší jejich použití na internetu. Cílem kryptoměn je, aby si lidé posílali peníze tak snadno, jako emaily, řekl Horák.Virtuální digitální měny jsou podle Horáka logickým evolučním krokem v historickém vývoji obchodování. Po výměnném obchodu přišly zbožové peníze, po nich klasické mince ze vzácných kovů, které byly nahrazeny papírovými penězi krytými zlatem. Následující vývoj pak od krytí upustil a státy bez problémů emitují miliardy v nových bankovkách každý rok. Měna je dnes využívána jako velmi účinný nástroj moci, řekl Horák.Hynek HorákKlasické peníze jsou označovány jako „fiat měny“, tedy jako peníze s nuceným oběhem, které jsou vytvořené úřední mocí. Zdálo by se, že taková měna je naprosto stabilní a neměnná, ale je to jen zdání. Dnes má statut světové měny americký dolar, ale nebylo tomu tak vždy. Mnoho zemí, v čele s Čínou, volá po změně tohoto stavu. Dolar je navíc rezervní měnou jen několik posledních desetiletí, předtím to byla libra, před ní frank a další měny. Průměrná životnost fiat měny je 27 let, varoval Horák. Podle jeho slov neexistuje precedens, že by fiat měna měla být skutečně úspěšná v udržení své hodnoty. Důvody jejich krachu jsou různé: 20 % bylo zničeno hyperinflací, 21 % zničila válka, 12 % vyhlášení nezávislosti, 24 % podlehlo měnovým reformám (včetně zavedení eura). Zbytek (23 %) je zatím stále v oběhu, ale směřuje k jednomu z těchto konců, vysvětlil Horák.Ani dolar už není zdaleka tak silný, jako býval dříve. Proti roku 1971 klesla jeho hodnota zhruba na 20 %. Ještě hůře je na tom britská libra, která je nejstarší měnou na světě a byla založena v roce 1694. Je tedy v oběhu 317 let a původně byla definována jako 12 uncí stříbra. Dnes má však jedna libra hodnotu jedné dvousetiny unce stříbra, tedy asi 0,5 % původní hodnoty. Nejlépe je na tom naopak pravděpodobně švýcarský frank, jehož hodnota od roku 1971 klesla „jen“ asi na 70 %.Proti tomu například bitcoin má velký potenciál růstu. Zatímco v říjnu 2008 stál jeden dolar 1300 BTC, na začátku roku 2014 byl 1 BTC za 1200 dolarů. Kurz se tedy úplně obrátil. Historicky první objednaná pizza stála 10 000 bitcoinů, což by bylo při dnešním kurzu asi 120 milionů korun. Kryptoměny mají tedy řadu výhod a především se díky svému principu mohou stát výrazně trvalejší hodnotou než klasické peníze ovlivňované vládní politikou, reformami, inflací či válkami.Pavel Hejl: kryptoměny nejsou měnyKolem kryptoměn je stále řada otázek, mezi nimi například také ta, jak se k nim vlastně staví současná legislativa. Na to se pokusil odpovědět advokát Pavel Hejl. Svou přednášku začal tím, jaký je vlastně rozdíl mezi penězi, elektronickými penězi a virtuálními penězi. Virtuální peníze obvykle vydává provozovatel nějakého herního světa a jejich cílem je maximalizace zisku, popsal „peníze“ známé například z her World of Warcraft nebo Second Life. Ty ovšem nejsou klasickými elektronickými penězi, protože nesplňují definici podle zákona o platebním styku (§ 4) – nepředstavují pohledávku vůči tomu, kdo ji vydal. Elektronickými penězi jsou podle zákona například finance nahrané ve formě kreditu například na městskou kartu.Pavel HejlKryptoměny jsou další samostatnou položkou, která nesplňuje definici žádné z těchto měn. Nejde o virtuální peníze, protože je neemituje jedna společnost v rámci žádného virtuálního světa. Nejde o elektronické peníze, protože jejich přijetím nevzniká pohledávka vůči vydavateli. A nejde ani o klasické peníze. Podle nového občanského zákoníka jde o „věc movitou nehmotnou“, protože můžeme vyjít z toho, že jde o věc (není to osoba), jde o věc movitou (není vyjmenována mezi nemovitými věcmi) a je nehmotná (nemá povahu samostatného předmětu). Bitcoin má tedy spíše povahu virtuální komodity, jakéhosi digitálního zlata.Kromě tohoto právního rozboru je k dispozici také stanovisko ČNB z 10. února 2014. Podle něj bitcoin nemá charakter pohledávky za jinou osobou – nejsou to elektronické peníze, resp. peněžní prostředky. Zároveň ovšem nákup či prodej bitcoinu není platební služba a měna bitcoinu za Kč nenaplňuje znaky směnárenského obchodu. Z tohoto stanoviska jasně plyne, že obchodování s bitcoiny nevyžaduje povolení České národní banky a nepodléhá jejímu dohledu, vysvětlil Hejl. Upozornil ovšem na to, že je potřeba bitcoinům věnovat zvláštní pozornost z hlediska AML předpisů. Tedy praní špinavých peněz.Zároveň je potřeba si uvědomit, že v českém prostředí nelze obchodovat výhradně bitcoiny, protože české koruny jsou zákonnými penězi při všech platbách na území ČR (Zákon o ČNB, § 16). Při soustavném odmítání korun by se společnost vystavovala obvinění z trestného činu ohrožování oběhu tuzemských peněz, varoval Hejl.Pavel HejlNa konci přednášky se věnoval také tomu, jak bitcoiny účtovat. Já osobně bych účtoval nadvakrát. Jednou na speciální účet (sklad) a pak podruhé v korunách, vysvětlil advokát. Je to tedy podobné, jako by vám někdo platil třeba ve zlatě. Podle slov Pavla Hejla je pro finanční úřad zásadní, že budou na dokladech uvedeny ceny v korunách. Když úřednice uvidí nějaký bitcoin, vůbec nebude vědět, co to je a jak s tím zacházet. Částka v korunách je proto jistotou, že vše proběhne účetně správně, uzavřel Pavel Hejl.Marek ‚Slush‘ Palatinus: slabým článkem jsou uživateléMarek Palatinus, známý v komunitě jako Slush, je jedním z nejviditelnějších českých popularizátorů bitcoinu a je tvůrcem myšlenky těžebního poolu. V něm se uživatelé spojují a společně těží bitcoiny, odměna je pak mezi ně rovnoměrně rozložena. Ve své přednášce se zabýval bezpečností bitcoinu, což je často diskutované téma napříč světovými médii. Bitcoin je postaven na velmi silných kryptografických základech. Všechno kolem je už ale děravé a nebezpečné, začal svou přednášku. Bezpečnostní mezery se týkají počítačů, mobilních telefonů, webových stránek, serveru a především samotných uživatelů.Klasický finanční systém je totiž založený na důvěře v instituce. Uživatel si vybere banku, které věří, a u té uloží peníze. Musíme se ale naučit, že v případě bitcoinů to neplatí. Pokud nedržíte klíče, nemáte v ruce nic, vysvětlil zásadní rozdíl Palatinus. Uživatelé ale velmi často a rádi používají různé webové peněženky nebo jednoduché mobilní aplikace. Ty jsou sice nebezpečné, ale velmi dobře se používají a peníze máme kdykoliv k dispozici. Je tu tedy rozpor mezi bezpečností a použitelností. Při rozumném použití je ale možné kombinovat poměrně bezpečně obě varianty. Když půjdu na pivo, dám si do mobilní peněženky pár stokorun a s těmi vyrazím ven. Je to jako klasická peněženka v kapse, taky v ní nenosím celoživotní úspory.Marek ‚Slush‘ PalatinusProtože útoků na bitcoinový software stále přibývá, přišel Marek Palatinus s hardwarovým řešením jménem Trezor. To umožňuje držet klíče v malém zařízení, které dokáže požadavky podepisovat, ale nikdy útočníkovi nevydá citlivé informace. Trezor připojíte USB kabelem, počítač do něj pošle šablonu transakce a vy jen tlačítkem potvrdíte, zda chcete platbu podepsat a poslat zpět počítači, vysvětlil Palatinus princip Trezoru. Jde tedy vlastně o obdobu čipové platební karty, která má ovšem navíc displej a tlačítka pro přesné potvrzení konkrétní transakce.Celý vývoj byl financován pomocí crowdfundingu, což je moderní metoda výběru peněz od budoucích uživatelů. V tomto případě ale nebyl použit populární Kickstarter. Lidé z Kickstarteru s námi odmítli komunikovat, takže jsme peníze vybrali v bitcoinech. Dodatečně jsme si spočítali, že jsme jen na poplatcích ušetřili zhruba 40 %. V tuto chvíli stále běží vývoj a existuje několik prototypů rozdělených mezi testery. Ti mají k dispozici web myTREZOR.com, na kterém mohou provozovat svou webovou peněženku. Jde ale jen o webové rozhraní k Trezoru, nejsou tam žádné klíče, uživatelské účty ani identity. Není co ukrást. Vše podstatné máte u sebe v Trezoru.Trezor, neprodejná hliníková verzePadl dotaz, zda případná ztráta či poškození Trezoru nebude znamenat také ztrátu bitcoinů. Při inicializaci konkrétního Trezoru se na displeji objeví dvanáct anglických slov. Pokud si je opíšete a bezpečně uložíte, můžete si pořídit další Trezor a ten pomocí nich inicializovat do stejného stavu, včetně stejných klíčů, uklidňuje Marek Palatinus.Zařízení by se mělo začít oficiálně prodávat během července a jeho koncová cena je stanovená na 100 dolarů. K dispozici bude nakonec jen plastová verze. Přestože sám Marek Palatinus nosí v kapse hliníkový Trezor, ten vůbec nepůjde do výroby. V každém případě by ale mělo jít o velmi jednoduché zařízení, přestože se uživatelé podle Palatinuse ptají na Wi-Fi, dotykové displeje a další vlastnosti. Našim cílem je jednoúčelové bezpečné zařízení. Nechceme konkurovat levným čínským Androidům, řekl na závěr.Jan Hrach: těžba už se vůbec nevyplatíJan Hrach se ve své přednášce zabýval tím, co vlastně generuje bitcoiny a drží celou síť při životě – těžba. Původně byl bitcoin navržen tak, aby každý mohl těžit na procesoru ve svém počítači. Ten umožňuje vypočítat řádově 1 MH /s. Později se ale přešlo na těžbu na grafických kartách. Ty obsahují stovky malých procesorů, které obvykle kreslí pixely na obrazovku, ale je možné je naprogramovat na jinou úlohu, vysvětlil Hrach a poukázal na to, že grafické čipy jsou v tomto případě asi stokrát výkonnější.Jan HrachPozději byly vymyšleny další metody, například těžba pomocí specializovaných obvodů naprogramovaných do FPGA. To jsou čipy obsahující určitou sadu součástek, které je možné elektricky propojovat a tím vytvářet vlastní zařízení. Výkon je sice podobný jako u grafických karet (100 MH/s), ale příkon je řádově nižší, takže je možné snadno paralelizovat víc podobných čipů. Dalším stupněm byla těžba pomocí ASIC obvodů, které se začaly objevovat v první polovině roku 2013. Elektrické propojení uvnitř FPGA je přeci jen relativně pomalé. Je proto lepší vytvořit úplně nový specializovaný ASIC čip, řekl Hrach.Problém ASIC je v tom, že jsou velmi drahé. Počáteční výrobní náklady na první sérii se pohybují v řádech milionů korun. Proto se někteří výrobci rozhodli financovat vývoj a výrobu pomocí crowdfundingu. Často jde ale o podvod. Pošlete peníze na vývoj, ale zařízení se nikdy nedočkáte. Pokud ovšem svůj ASIC miner dostanete, může se jeho výkon pohybovat až v řádu desítek GH/s. Kdo je měl první, ten si pravděpodobně mohl natěžit poměrně slušné množství bitcoinů, dnes už to nemá smysl, řekl Hrach s tím, že pokročilá zařízení stojí i stovky tisíc korun.Výkon sítě stále exponenciálně rosteBitcoinová síť se sama přizpůsobuje celkovému výkonu těžařů, takže obtížnost vypočítávané úlohy stále stoupá. V současné době je celkový výkon sítě zhruba 100 PH/s, tedy zhruba miliardkrát vyšší než výkon jednoho počítače. Těžit bitcoiny se tedy dnes už vůbec nevyplatí. I když nemusíte platit elektřinu, tak při započtení ceny ASIC a všech dalších nákladů budete pravděpodobně na nule, řekl Hrach.Problém se snaží řešit některé alternativní sítě pomocí změny algoritmu. SHA-2 použitý u bitcoinu je totiž možné poměrně snadno počítat právě na výše uvedených specializovaných zařízeních. Proti tomu například scrypt, který se používá v síti Litecoin, je podstatně paměťově náročnější a využívá náhodných přístupů do paměti. Paměť na FPGA a ASIC je velmi drahá a i když si ji vyrobíte, stejně vám náhodné přístupy znemožní ji využívat jako cache. Bohužel i pro Litecoin už se začínají objevovat ASIC, které dokáží vypočítat 50 MH/s a jejichž cena se pohybuje okolo 50 tisíc korun. Největší chybou vývojářů Litecoinu bylo, že v tu chvíli odmítli změnit algoritmus. Tím celý Litecoin postrádá smysl, řekl k tématu Marek Palatinus.Scrypt není jediným pokusem řešit tento problém, mezi další patří například nscrypt, X11 nebo CryptoNote. Nscrypt má konfigurovatelnou spotřebu paměti, takže když se objeví první ASIC s dostatečnou kapacitou, je možné nároky zvýšit a tím mu znemožnit efektivní fungování. X11 využívá kaskádu jedenácti hashovacích algoritmů, což opět komplikuje implementaci v čipech. Musíte implementovat jedenáct nezávislých jader, která si hash předávají. Navíc kdyby byla jedna z funkcí v budoucnu prolomena, neohrozí to bezpečnost celého protokolu, řekl Hrach. Krátce zmíněný CryptoNote jde na věc také přes velkou spotřebu paměti.', 'Amnesty InternationalAmnesty international has launched an open-source \'Panic Button\' app designed to help human rights activists at risk from attack, kidnap or torture.AdvertisementThe Android app -- which can be disguised as a calculator on the mobile phone -- can send an SMS distress signal to other activists so that they can mobilise action within the first few hours. The secret alarm is designed to protect activists who frequently put themselves at risk to help others, facing arrest, attack, kidnap or torture.People who download the app (which needs a minimum of Android 2.3.3) can set up three pre-warned contacts to receive alerts in an emergency -- ideally people who can practically assist the individual. In advance of going somewhere where he or she might be in danger, the individual can write a message that will be triggered in an emergency. Individuals are encouraged to use code words and phrases that only his or her contacts will understand. To trigger the message, the user needs only to rapidly press the phone\'s power button -- five times in five seconds until they feel a vibration: this will send the pre-written message along with the sender\'s GPS location.Alternatively, the user can type the number 1 repeatedly on the mock calculator.Read next Steering spy planes using air flows could make them harder to detect Steering spy planes using air flows could make them harder to detectAmnesty\'s Technology and Human Rights Officer Tanya O\'Carroll said: ""We have long known that the first hours after somebody\'s arrest are the crucial window of opportunity for a network to make a difference to their colleague\'s release -- whether it be flooding the police station with calls, arranging a protest, or mobilising lawyers and organisations like Amnesty International for a campaign of international pressure.""The app has been beta tested by more than 100 activists and journalists across 17 different countries. It\'s now available to download on Android through the Google Play store.For people who live in countries known to practise mass telecommunications monitoring and interception (oh dear USA, UK, Australia et al!) against activists, this app may not be the best tool as it may reveal information about your location and trusted contacts that could put you all at risk.AdvertisementAn Amnesty International spokeswoman told Wired.co.uk that this was a major consideration when developing the app. ""We are painfully aware of the insecurity of telecommunications networks around the world. The mobile networks that allow users to send an SMS are not built to protect privacy or the content of messages.This is true for all calls and SMS communications, including SMS alerts sent by Panic Button.""This meant that the human rights organisation needed to think carefully about ""security trade-offs"". By consulting with a wide range of human rights activists, the resounding response was that the ""possibility of having an SMS alert intercepted was a risk worth taking in exchange for the ability to get word out fast of being physically endangered"".The Panic Button has been in development for more than a year. The idea initially came about through an open design process carried out in collaboration with OpenIDEO in 2012.Since then, it has drawn upon the skills of many designers, activists and developers using partners Frontline Defenders, iilab and the Engine Room.AdvertisementPlans for further development include allowing the live transmission of a video recording and the ability to shut down an individuals\' email and social media accounts so that their wider network can be protected.

The success of the jihadi group, whose lightning-fast takeover of northern Iraq in recent days has brought the country to the verge of civil war, has been built on a lucrative and sprawling array of financial interests built up unimpeded over years. With the takeover of Mosul, and the estimated $425m windfall of loot stolen from the city’s central bank, Isis has been catapulted into a position of unrivalled wealth. “They’re probably the richest jihadi organisation ever seen,” says Aaron Zelin, a fellow at the Washington Institute, and an expert on extremism. “They get their money from trafficking weapons, kidnappings for ransom, counterfeit currencies, oil refining, smuggling artefacts that are thousands of years old and from taxes that they have for areas they are in – either on businesses, or at checkpoints or on ordinary people,” he adds. After Isis seized Mosul, residents of Raqqa, the first town taken over by the group, said militants celebrated by throwing money into the streets and parading in US-made tanks and humvees seized from abandoned army bases in Iraq. “They’ve been throwing 200-lira notes to people and circling around in the streets, celebrating on their new humvees. I counted 50 tanks too,” says a resident in the city. Building a picture of the specifics of Isis’s shadowy activities and assessing the true scale of its assets is not easy. But in interviews with regional and western security officials, and analysis of open-source information, a picture emerges of a carefully run and meticulously accounted financial operation. “Most jihadist groups are tightly controlled, secretive and well co-ordinated, but Isis has essentially taken that to another level, with a quite impressive level of bureaucracy, extensive account keeping, and multiple channels of accountability,” says Charles Lister, an analyst at the Brookings Doha Centre. Isis has “hundreds of millions”, if not more than $1bn, in assets, one intelligence official estimates – a figure others concur with, or even see as being conservative, though they stress this is not all in hard currency. Unlike other jihadi groups, Isis has been pragmatic in diversifying its sources of funding. In particular, it has been at pains to avoid reliance on donations from private individuals in Gulf states – traditionally, the largest source of income for al-Qaeda linked terror groups. “They have made a conscious effort to be independent,” says Mr Zelin. “They don’t trust anybody and they don’t rely on anybody. They want to be totally self-sufficient.” At the centre of Isis’s activities is oil. The group has fought bitter battles in Syria with other radical jihadis – particularly those from al-Qaeda’s official affiliate Jabhat Al-Nusra – for control of oilfields. In the vicinity of Raqqah, its most strongly entrenched position, Isis rebels extract as much as 30,000 barrels daily according to one intelligence official. Although modest compared with the peak of 300,000 b/d extracted by the Syrian government, the production generates sizeable revenues. The oil is sold at knockdown rates to middlemen, who then transport it to Turkey and spirit it away in huge quantities into Iraq. Turkish officials have even discovered rudimentary pipelines buried just below the surface to smuggle oil across the border. Isis also – controversially – sells oil to the Assad regime, according to several independent sources with close knowledge of the matter. The regime “keeps the lights on” in some Isis-controlled cities in exchange for barrels, one western intelligence official says. It is little wonder that Isis’s latest advances in Iraq are now focused around the Baiji refinery: gaining it would not only be a significant blow to the Iraqi government and the energy security of Baghdad, but it would give Isis access to a huge asset that could allow it to begin refining at scale. The second pillar of the group’s financial strength comes from more overtly criminal activities, including looting. Isis has earned “tens of millions” in Syria through kidnappings and ransoms, one western counter terrorism official estimates. Interactive map Isis advances through Iraq and Syria Chart the progress of the jihadi militants as they attempt to gain more ground “They have been very, very successful in kidnapping for ransom,” says Shashank Joshi, a fellow at the military think-tank RUSI in London. “That was one of their main sources of income all through last year. Western governments have been among those paying large sums.” Isis is also believed to be engaged the smuggling of antiquities, though the scale is hard to gauge. The third source of income – and perhaps the most revealing when it comes to Isis’s own image of itself – is extortion and taxation in the name of its “state”. In Raqqa, for example, Isis’s ruling sharia council last month issued a decree imposing Zakat – an almsgiving tax – set at 10 per cent of income. It also imposed a tax on Christians. Even before its formal takeover of Mosul, the group was extorting an estimated $8m from the city’s businesses each month, according to the commander of the province’s police, General Mahdi Gharawi. Checkpoints across the border between Iraq and Syria and along key trade routes in Isis-controlled areas are also lucrative points of taxation from traders. Isis’s own documents show it established 30 checkpoints in 2013 in Iraq alone. The group’s formidable ability to earn money is matched by a canny ability to spend it, all part of its strategy of taking on the trappings of a state. “Isis clearly places a significant focus upon controlling terrain and population and upon raising funds for reinvestment into areas under its control as well as into further and expanded military operations,” says the Brookings Centre’s Mr Lister.  “I’d estimate Isis’s operating cost of probably being over $10m. It is thought to pay its fighters around $400-$500 per month, so even that amounts to at least $5m over a month, without even considering more considerable operating costs of managing entire cities and towns. Isis runs a big operation, and largely by itself.”']","['The Philippines welcomes its first Bitcoin ATM. Brought by Satoshi Citadel Industries and Bitmarket.ph, the machine will be ordered from Skyhook and will cost $US 999. ATMs are no longer exciting news, yet this one is a lot smaller in size and it will speak to the success of Bitcoins on a global scale. The ATM will appeal to a wealth of people and cultures with money to trade and transactions to process.A better understanding of Project SkyhookWhat is Skyhook? Skyhook is an open-source Bitcoin ATM. Selling Bitcoins was once difficult, and many people were tired of depending on exchanges and centralized banks to buy Bitcoins. Skyhook changed everything. The company developed a tiny and secure machine everyone can use to exchange Bitcoins.It comes with a hefty security mounting plate and a password-on-boot options. It someone steals it, you have nothing to worry as your Bitcoins will be safe. The ATM accepts Australian, US, and Canadian dollars, as well as Argentinean Pesos, Yuan, Euros, and numerous other currencies.Easy to set up, Skyhook comes with a detailed guide you should use to get started. Buyers will require a Wi-Fi or wired internet connection, a power cable, and Bitcoins to sell. The touch-screen graphical interface of Skyhook will ease your job to buy Bitcoins and make use of the QR code for wallet address recognition.Skyhook sets Bitcoin prices automatically using major exchanges. Afterwards, it adds a minimum price protection so that you can get paid for using Bitcoins. The ATM machine is excellent for vendors, storefronts, bars, meet-ups, and merchants. Set your rate and start trading.Bitcoin, a global phenomenon now available in compact size in the PhilippinesUnlike the other two popular Bitcoin machines, Lamassu and Robocoin, Skyhook is a lot smaller, and of course, less expensive. Owned by a Filipino company known as Bitmarket.ph, locals will finally be able to trade Bitcoins with Philippine pesos and not have to worry about exchange rates. To use Bitmarket.ph all you have to do is activate and access your account. Next, type your transaction\'s details (details of the buyer and item for sale). Enter your selling price and exchange it in Bitcoins immediately.Generate a QR code and use the code to share it with clients. Bitmarket additionally offers cash settlements where you can convert Bitcoins into Philippine pesos daily. Bitcoins provide fast, real time transactions to customers. Trading Bitcoins keeps people away from chargebacks, bank fees, and commissions. Unlike other forms of exchange, Bitcoins provide transparency where you can track each one of your transactions in real time. Vendors accepting Bitcoins are essentially adding value to their business by gaining a competitive advantage as a first adopter and cutting costs.Now that the Philippines is finally welcoming its first Bitcoin ATM, people will ""dispense Bitcoins for Pesos on the spot in a matter of seconds at competitive and fair rates.”', 'Local news reports are informing the general public that Bolivia’s central bank – El Banco Central de Bolivia – has officially announced that it has banned any currency or coins that are not regulated by the government. This includes bitcoin as well as several other virtual currencies, including feathercoin, namecoin, peercoin, primecoin and Quark.The newest policy was actually made earlier last month but it has only since made the headlines in the South American nation, including in the Spanish news publication the PanAm Post. What’s interesting is that this is the first and only announcement relating to the peer-to-peer decentralized virtual currency made by the central bank.The purpose of the ban is protect the bolivaro and to protect consumers and investors from doling out money into these kinds of currencies that they believe are high risk, unsafe and pose a threat to the national currency.According to a translation of the article, the central bank noted that citizens are banned from denominating prices in any type of currency that is not officially recognized, regulated or approved by government agencies.Other countries have considered or believed to have been in the midst of implementing prohibitive measures against bitcoins and other digital currencies. China, Russia and Thailand had imposed restrictive controls on bitcoin, which many had believed would lead to a nationwide ban. Instead, the nations have backtracked on this and even one People’s Bank of China official confirmed it would not ban bitcoin.Sebastian Serrano, CEO of Argentina bitcoin merchant processor BitPagos, told CoinDesk that this won’t really hinder bitcoin operations. Nevertheless, in a country that suffers from massive bouts of poverty, this is really a regressive stance.“The news from Bolivia is very sad, especially considering it is one of the poorest countries in Latin America,” said Serrano. “Hopefully, Bolivia will revert its decision in the future as bitcoin continues to prosper in the rest of the world.”This hasn’t necessarily affected the price of bitcoin as it remains close to the $600 mark.', 'V úterý 17. června se v Národní technické knihovně v pražských Dejvicích konala konference Bitcoin a další kryptoměny, která se zabývala současností a budoucností virtuálních měn. Sešli se na ní těžaři, vývojáři, provozovatelé burz, ale i obchodníci a zprostředkovatelé platebních bran. Nejen Blockchainem živ je bitcoin a plně funkční měna vyžaduje celý ekosystém, který právě kolem bitcoinu teprve vzniká.Hynek Horák: peníze potřebují (r)evoluciV úvodní přednášce se Hynek Horák zabýval změnami, které ve společnosti proběhly za poslední desetiletí. Prakticky všechny stránky lidského života prošly zásadní přeměnou, kromě jediné. Komunikace, média, způsob práce, nakupování i zábava prošly velkou změnou. Jen peníze zůstaly stále stejné, řekl Horák. Právě nové digitální měny by mohly být onou revolucí, která peníze zmodernizuje a zjednoduší jejich použití na internetu. Cílem kryptoměn je, aby si lidé posílali peníze tak snadno, jako emaily, řekl Horák.Virtuální digitální měny jsou podle Horáka logickým evolučním krokem v historickém vývoji obchodování. Po výměnném obchodu přišly zbožové peníze, po nich klasické mince ze vzácných kovů, které byly nahrazeny papírovými penězi krytými zlatem. Následující vývoj pak od krytí upustil a státy bez problémů emitují miliardy v nových bankovkách každý rok. Měna je dnes využívána jako velmi účinný nástroj moci, řekl Horák.Hynek HorákKlasické peníze jsou označovány jako „fiat měny“, tedy jako peníze s nuceným oběhem, které jsou vytvořené úřední mocí. Zdálo by se, že taková měna je naprosto stabilní a neměnná, ale je to jen zdání. Dnes má statut světové měny americký dolar, ale nebylo tomu tak vždy. Mnoho zemí, v čele s Čínou, volá po změně tohoto stavu. Dolar je navíc rezervní měnou jen několik posledních desetiletí, předtím to byla libra, před ní frank a další měny. Průměrná životnost fiat měny je 27 let, varoval Horák. Podle jeho slov neexistuje precedens, že by fiat měna měla být skutečně úspěšná v udržení své hodnoty. Důvody jejich krachu jsou různé: 20 % bylo zničeno hyperinflací, 21 % zničila válka, 12 % vyhlášení nezávislosti, 24 % podlehlo měnovým reformám (včetně zavedení eura). Zbytek (23 %) je zatím stále v oběhu, ale směřuje k jednomu z těchto konců, vysvětlil Horák.Ani dolar už není zdaleka tak silný, jako býval dříve. Proti roku 1971 klesla jeho hodnota zhruba na 20 %. Ještě hůře je na tom britská libra, která je nejstarší měnou na světě a byla založena v roce 1694. Je tedy v oběhu 317 let a původně byla definována jako 12 uncí stříbra. Dnes má však jedna libra hodnotu jedné dvousetiny unce stříbra, tedy asi 0,5 % původní hodnoty. Nejlépe je na tom naopak pravděpodobně švýcarský frank, jehož hodnota od roku 1971 klesla „jen“ asi na 70 %.Proti tomu například bitcoin má velký potenciál růstu. Zatímco v říjnu 2008 stál jeden dolar 1300 BTC, na začátku roku 2014 byl 1 BTC za 1200 dolarů. Kurz se tedy úplně obrátil. Historicky první objednaná pizza stála 10 000 bitcoinů, což by bylo při dnešním kurzu asi 120 milionů korun. Kryptoměny mají tedy řadu výhod a především se díky svému principu mohou stát výrazně trvalejší hodnotou než klasické peníze ovlivňované vládní politikou, reformami, inflací či válkami.Pavel Hejl: kryptoměny nejsou měnyKolem kryptoměn je stále řada otázek, mezi nimi například také ta, jak se k nim vlastně staví současná legislativa. Na to se pokusil odpovědět advokát Pavel Hejl. Svou přednášku začal tím, jaký je vlastně rozdíl mezi penězi, elektronickými penězi a virtuálními penězi. Virtuální peníze obvykle vydává provozovatel nějakého herního světa a jejich cílem je maximalizace zisku, popsal „peníze“ známé například z her World of Warcraft nebo Second Life. Ty ovšem nejsou klasickými elektronickými penězi, protože nesplňují definici podle zákona o platebním styku (§ 4) – nepředstavují pohledávku vůči tomu, kdo ji vydal. Elektronickými penězi jsou podle zákona například finance nahrané ve formě kreditu například na městskou kartu.Pavel HejlKryptoměny jsou další samostatnou položkou, která nesplňuje definici žádné z těchto měn. Nejde o virtuální peníze, protože je neemituje jedna společnost v rámci žádného virtuálního světa. Nejde o elektronické peníze, protože jejich přijetím nevzniká pohledávka vůči vydavateli. A nejde ani o klasické peníze. Podle nového občanského zákoníka jde o „věc movitou nehmotnou“, protože můžeme vyjít z toho, že jde o věc (není to osoba), jde o věc movitou (není vyjmenována mezi nemovitými věcmi) a je nehmotná (nemá povahu samostatného předmětu). Bitcoin má tedy spíše povahu virtuální komodity, jakéhosi digitálního zlata.Kromě tohoto právního rozboru je k dispozici také stanovisko ČNB z 10. února 2014. Podle něj bitcoin nemá charakter pohledávky za jinou osobou – nejsou to elektronické peníze, resp. peněžní prostředky. Zároveň ovšem nákup či prodej bitcoinu není platební služba a měna bitcoinu za Kč nenaplňuje znaky směnárenského obchodu. Z tohoto stanoviska jasně plyne, že obchodování s bitcoiny nevyžaduje povolení České národní banky a nepodléhá jejímu dohledu, vysvětlil Hejl. Upozornil ovšem na to, že je potřeba bitcoinům věnovat zvláštní pozornost z hlediska AML předpisů. Tedy praní špinavých peněz.Zároveň je potřeba si uvědomit, že v českém prostředí nelze obchodovat výhradně bitcoiny, protože české koruny jsou zákonnými penězi při všech platbách na území ČR (Zákon o ČNB, § 16). Při soustavném odmítání korun by se společnost vystavovala obvinění z trestného činu ohrožování oběhu tuzemských peněz, varoval Hejl.Pavel HejlNa konci přednášky se věnoval také tomu, jak bitcoiny účtovat. Já osobně bych účtoval nadvakrát. Jednou na speciální účet (sklad) a pak podruhé v korunách, vysvětlil advokát. Je to tedy podobné, jako by vám někdo platil třeba ve zlatě. Podle slov Pavla Hejla je pro finanční úřad zásadní, že budou na dokladech uvedeny ceny v korunách. Když úřednice uvidí nějaký bitcoin, vůbec nebude vědět, co to je a jak s tím zacházet. Částka v korunách je proto jistotou, že vše proběhne účetně správně, uzavřel Pavel Hejl.Marek ‚Slush‘ Palatinus: slabým článkem jsou uživateléMarek Palatinus, známý v komunitě jako Slush, je jedním z nejviditelnějších českých popularizátorů bitcoinu a je tvůrcem myšlenky těžebního poolu. V něm se uživatelé spojují a společně těží bitcoiny, odměna je pak mezi ně rovnoměrně rozložena. Ve své přednášce se zabýval bezpečností bitcoinu, což je často diskutované téma napříč světovými médii. Bitcoin je postaven na velmi silných kryptografických základech. Všechno kolem je už ale děravé a nebezpečné, začal svou přednášku. Bezpečnostní mezery se týkají počítačů, mobilních telefonů, webových stránek, serveru a především samotných uživatelů.Klasický finanční systém je totiž založený na důvěře v instituce. Uživatel si vybere banku, které věří, a u té uloží peníze. Musíme se ale naučit, že v případě bitcoinů to neplatí. Pokud nedržíte klíče, nemáte v ruce nic, vysvětlil zásadní rozdíl Palatinus. Uživatelé ale velmi často a rádi používají různé webové peněženky nebo jednoduché mobilní aplikace. Ty jsou sice nebezpečné, ale velmi dobře se používají a peníze máme kdykoliv k dispozici. Je tu tedy rozpor mezi bezpečností a použitelností. Při rozumném použití je ale možné kombinovat poměrně bezpečně obě varianty. Když půjdu na pivo, dám si do mobilní peněženky pár stokorun a s těmi vyrazím ven. Je to jako klasická peněženka v kapse, taky v ní nenosím celoživotní úspory.Marek ‚Slush‘ PalatinusProtože útoků na bitcoinový software stále přibývá, přišel Marek Palatinus s hardwarovým řešením jménem Trezor. To umožňuje držet klíče v malém zařízení, které dokáže požadavky podepisovat, ale nikdy útočníkovi nevydá citlivé informace. Trezor připojíte USB kabelem, počítač do něj pošle šablonu transakce a vy jen tlačítkem potvrdíte, zda chcete platbu podepsat a poslat zpět počítači, vysvětlil Palatinus princip Trezoru. Jde tedy vlastně o obdobu čipové platební karty, která má ovšem navíc displej a tlačítka pro přesné potvrzení konkrétní transakce.Celý vývoj byl financován pomocí crowdfundingu, což je moderní metoda výběru peněz od budoucích uživatelů. V tomto případě ale nebyl použit populární Kickstarter. Lidé z Kickstarteru s námi odmítli komunikovat, takže jsme peníze vybrali v bitcoinech. Dodatečně jsme si spočítali, že jsme jen na poplatcích ušetřili zhruba 40 %. V tuto chvíli stále běží vývoj a existuje několik prototypů rozdělených mezi testery. Ti mají k dispozici web myTREZOR.com, na kterém mohou provozovat svou webovou peněženku. Jde ale jen o webové rozhraní k Trezoru, nejsou tam žádné klíče, uživatelské účty ani identity. Není co ukrást. Vše podstatné máte u sebe v Trezoru.Trezor, neprodejná hliníková verzePadl dotaz, zda případná ztráta či poškození Trezoru nebude znamenat také ztrátu bitcoinů. Při inicializaci konkrétního Trezoru se na displeji objeví dvanáct anglických slov. Pokud si je opíšete a bezpečně uložíte, můžete si pořídit další Trezor a ten pomocí nich inicializovat do stejného stavu, včetně stejných klíčů, uklidňuje Marek Palatinus.Zařízení by se mělo začít oficiálně prodávat během července a jeho koncová cena je stanovená na 100 dolarů. K dispozici bude nakonec jen plastová verze. Přestože sám Marek Palatinus nosí v kapse hliníkový Trezor, ten vůbec nepůjde do výroby. V každém případě by ale mělo jít o velmi jednoduché zařízení, přestože se uživatelé podle Palatinuse ptají na Wi-Fi, dotykové displeje a další vlastnosti. Našim cílem je jednoúčelové bezpečné zařízení. Nechceme konkurovat levným čínským Androidům, řekl na závěr.Jan Hrach: těžba už se vůbec nevyplatíJan Hrach se ve své přednášce zabýval tím, co vlastně generuje bitcoiny a drží celou síť při životě – těžba. Původně byl bitcoin navržen tak, aby každý mohl těžit na procesoru ve svém počítači. Ten umožňuje vypočítat řádově 1 MH /s. Později se ale přešlo na těžbu na grafických kartách. Ty obsahují stovky malých procesorů, které obvykle kreslí pixely na obrazovku, ale je možné je naprogramovat na jinou úlohu, vysvětlil Hrach a poukázal na to, že grafické čipy jsou v tomto případě asi stokrát výkonnější.Jan HrachPozději byly vymyšleny další metody, například těžba pomocí specializovaných obvodů naprogramovaných do FPGA. To jsou čipy obsahující určitou sadu součástek, které je možné elektricky propojovat a tím vytvářet vlastní zařízení. Výkon je sice podobný jako u grafických karet (100 MH/s), ale příkon je řádově nižší, takže je možné snadno paralelizovat víc podobných čipů. Dalším stupněm byla těžba pomocí ASIC obvodů, které se začaly objevovat v první polovině roku 2013. Elektrické propojení uvnitř FPGA je přeci jen relativně pomalé. Je proto lepší vytvořit úplně nový specializovaný ASIC čip, řekl Hrach.Problém ASIC je v tom, že jsou velmi drahé. Počáteční výrobní náklady na první sérii se pohybují v řádech milionů korun. Proto se někteří výrobci rozhodli financovat vývoj a výrobu pomocí crowdfundingu. Často jde ale o podvod. Pošlete peníze na vývoj, ale zařízení se nikdy nedočkáte. Pokud ovšem svůj ASIC miner dostanete, může se jeho výkon pohybovat až v řádu desítek GH/s. Kdo je měl první, ten si pravděpodobně mohl natěžit poměrně slušné množství bitcoinů, dnes už to nemá smysl, řekl Hrach s tím, že pokročilá zařízení stojí i stovky tisíc korun.Výkon sítě stále exponenciálně rosteBitcoinová síť se sama přizpůsobuje celkovému výkonu těžařů, takže obtížnost vypočítávané úlohy stále stoupá. V současné době je celkový výkon sítě zhruba 100 PH/s, tedy zhruba miliardkrát vyšší než výkon jednoho počítače. Těžit bitcoiny se tedy dnes už vůbec nevyplatí. I když nemusíte platit elektřinu, tak při započtení ceny ASIC a všech dalších nákladů budete pravděpodobně na nule, řekl Hrach.Problém se snaží řešit některé alternativní sítě pomocí změny algoritmu. SHA-2 použitý u bitcoinu je totiž možné poměrně snadno počítat právě na výše uvedených specializovaných zařízeních. Proti tomu například scrypt, který se používá v síti Litecoin, je podstatně paměťově náročnější a využívá náhodných přístupů do paměti. Paměť na FPGA a ASIC je velmi drahá a i když si ji vyrobíte, stejně vám náhodné přístupy znemožní ji využívat jako cache. Bohužel i pro Litecoin už se začínají objevovat ASIC, které dokáží vypočítat 50 MH/s a jejichž cena se pohybuje okolo 50 tisíc korun. Největší chybou vývojářů Litecoinu bylo, že v tu chvíli odmítli změnit algoritmus. Tím celý Litecoin postrádá smysl, řekl k tématu Marek Palatinus.Scrypt není jediným pokusem řešit tento problém, mezi další patří například nscrypt, X11 nebo CryptoNote. Nscrypt má konfigurovatelnou spotřebu paměti, takže když se objeví první ASIC s dostatečnou kapacitou, je možné nároky zvýšit a tím mu znemožnit efektivní fungování. X11 využívá kaskádu jedenácti hashovacích algoritmů, což opět komplikuje implementaci v čipech. Musíte implementovat jedenáct nezávislých jader, která si hash předávají. Navíc kdyby byla jedna z funkcí v budoucnu prolomena, neohrozí to bezpečnost celého protokolu, řekl Hrach. Krátce zmíněný CryptoNote jde na věc také přes velkou spotřebu paměti.', 'Amnesty InternationalAmnesty international has launched an open-source \'Panic Button\' app designed to help human rights activists at risk from attack, kidnap or torture.AdvertisementThe Android app -- which can be disguised as a calculator on the mobile phone -- can send an SMS distress signal to other activists so that they can mobilise action within the first few hours. The secret alarm is designed to protect activists who frequently put themselves at risk to help others, facing arrest, attack, kidnap or torture.People who download the app (which needs a minimum of Android 2.3.3) can set up three pre-warned contacts to receive alerts in an emergency -- ideally people who can practically assist the individual. In advance of going somewhere where he or she might be in danger, the individual can write a message that will be triggered in an emergency. Individuals are encouraged to use code words and phrases that only his or her contacts will understand. To trigger the message, the user needs only to rapidly press the phone\'s power button -- five times in five seconds until they feel a vibration: this will send the pre-written message along with the sender\'s GPS location.Alternatively, the user can type the number 1 repeatedly on the mock calculator.Read next Steering spy planes using air flows could make them harder to detect Steering spy planes using air flows could make them harder to detectAmnesty\'s Technology and Human Rights Officer Tanya O\'Carroll said: ""We have long known that the first hours after somebody\'s arrest are the crucial window of opportunity for a network to make a difference to their colleague\'s release -- whether it be flooding the police station with calls, arranging a protest, or mobilising lawyers and organisations like Amnesty International for a campaign of international pressure.""The app has been beta tested by more than 100 activists and journalists across 17 different countries. It\'s now available to download on Android through the Google Play store.For people who live in countries known to practise mass telecommunications monitoring and interception (oh dear USA, UK, Australia et al!) against activists, this app may not be the best tool as it may reveal information about your location and trusted contacts that could put you all at risk.AdvertisementAn Amnesty International spokeswoman told Wired.co.uk that this was a major consideration when developing the app. ""We are painfully aware of the insecurity of telecommunications networks around the world. The mobile networks that allow users to send an SMS are not built to protect privacy or the content of messages.This is true for all calls and SMS communications, including SMS alerts sent by Panic Button.""This meant that the human rights organisation needed to think carefully about ""security trade-offs"". By consulting with a wide range of human rights activists, the resounding response was that the ""possibility of having an SMS alert intercepted was a risk worth taking in exchange for the ability to get word out fast of being physically endangered"".The Panic Button has been in development for more than a year. The idea initially came about through an open design process carried out in collaboration with OpenIDEO in 2012.Since then, it has drawn upon the skills of many designers, activists and developers using partners Frontline Defenders, iilab and the Engine Room.AdvertisementPlans for further development include allowing the live transmission of a video recording and the ability to shut down an individuals\' email and social media accounts so that their wider network can be protected.

The success of the jihadi group, whose lightning-fast takeover of northern Iraq in recent days has brought the country to the verge of civil war, has been built on a lucrative and sprawling array of financial interests built up unimpeded over years. With the takeover of Mosul, and the estimated $425m windfall of loot stolen from the city’s central bank, Isis has been catapulted into a position of unrivalled wealth. “They’re probably the richest jihadi organisation ever seen,” says Aaron Zelin, a fellow at the Washington Institute, and an expert on extremism. “They get their money from trafficking weapons, kidnappings for ransom, counterfeit currencies, oil refining, smuggling artefacts that are thousands of years old and from taxes that they have for areas they are in – either on businesses, or at checkpoints or on ordinary people,” he adds. After Isis seized Mosul, residents of Raqqa, the first town taken over by the group, said militants celebrated by throwing money into the streets and parading in US-made tanks and humvees seized from abandoned army bases in Iraq. “They’ve been throwing 200-lira notes to people and circling around in the streets, celebrating on their new humvees. I counted 50 tanks too,” says a resident in the city. Building a picture of the specifics of Isis’s shadowy activities and assessing the true scale of its assets is not easy. But in interviews with regional and western security officials, and analysis of open-source information, a picture emerges of a carefully run and meticulously accounted financial operation. “Most jihadist groups are tightly controlled, secretive and well co-ordinated, but Isis has essentially taken that to another level, with a quite impressive level of bureaucracy, extensive account keeping, and multiple channels of accountability,” says Charles Lister, an analyst at the Brookings Doha Centre. Isis has “hundreds of millions”, if not more than $1bn, in assets, one intelligence official estimates – a figure others concur with, or even see as being conservative, though they stress this is not all in hard currency. Unlike other jihadi groups, Isis has been pragmatic in diversifying its sources of funding. In particular, it has been at pains to avoid reliance on donations from private individuals in Gulf states – traditionally, the largest source of income for al-Qaeda linked terror groups. “They have made a conscious effort to be independent,” says Mr Zelin. “They don’t trust anybody and they don’t rely on anybody. They want to be totally self-sufficient.” At the centre of Isis’s activities is oil. The group has fought bitter battles in Syria with other radical jihadis – particularly those from al-Qaeda’s official affiliate Jabhat Al-Nusra – for control of oilfields. In the vicinity of Raqqah, its most strongly entrenched position, Isis rebels extract as much as 30,000 barrels daily according to one intelligence official. Although modest compared with the peak of 300,000 b/d extracted by the Syrian government, the production generates sizeable revenues. The oil is sold at knockdown rates to middlemen, who then transport it to Turkey and spirit it away in huge quantities into Iraq. Turkish officials have even discovered rudimentary pipelines buried just below the surface to smuggle oil across the border. Isis also – controversially – sells oil to the Assad regime, according to several independent sources with close knowledge of the matter. The regime “keeps the lights on” in some Isis-controlled cities in exchange for barrels, one western intelligence official says. It is little wonder that Isis’s latest advances in Iraq are now focused around the Baiji refinery: gaining it would not only be a significant blow to the Iraqi government and the energy security of Baghdad, but it would give Isis access to a huge asset that could allow it to begin refining at scale. The second pillar of the group’s financial strength comes from more overtly criminal activities, including looting. Isis has earned “tens of millions” in Syria through kidnappings and ransoms, one western counter terrorism official estimates. Interactive map Isis advances through Iraq and Syria Chart the progress of the jihadi militants as they attempt to gain more ground “They have been very, very successful in kidnapping for ransom,” says Shashank Joshi, a fellow at the military think-tank RUSI in London. “That was one of their main sources of income all through last year. Western governments have been among those paying large sums.” Isis is also believed to be engaged the smuggling of antiquities, though the scale is hard to gauge. The third source of income – and perhaps the most revealing when it comes to Isis’s own image of itself – is extortion and taxation in the name of its “state”. In Raqqa, for example, Isis’s ruling sharia council last month issued a decree imposing Zakat – an almsgiving tax – set at 10 per cent of income. It also imposed a tax on Christians. Even before its formal takeover of Mosul, the group was extorting an estimated $8m from the city’s businesses each month, according to the commander of the province’s police, General Mahdi Gharawi. Checkpoints across the border between Iraq and Syria and along key trade routes in Isis-controlled areas are also lucrative points of taxation from traders. Isis’s own documents show it established 30 checkpoints in 2013 in Iraq alone. The group’s formidable ability to earn money is matched by a canny ability to spend it, all part of its strategy of taking on the trappings of a state. “Isis clearly places a significant focus upon controlling terrain and population and upon raising funds for reinvestment into areas under its control as well as into further and expanded military operations,” says the Brookings Centre’s Mr Lister.  “I’d estimate Isis’s operating cost of probably being over $10m. It is thought to pay its fighters around $400-$500 per month, so even that amounts to at least $5m over a month, without even considering more considerable operating costs of managing entire cities and towns. Isis runs a big operation, and largely by itself.”']"

Irvine described in detail how each node, connected over a peer-to-peer network, can infer rules and actions based on the message it receives.For example, a node may decide to store or communicate the data, assuming a persona similar to a soldier or cleaner ant, in response to the message. However, clearly, the analogy only goes so far: “MaidSafe nodes are like an ant colony, but the nodes are allowed to change their persona a million times per second.”It is as if MaidSafe is composed of nimble, digital organisms.\'Intellectual laziness\'When asked why experts have not followed a similar model, Irvine recounted how MaidSafe flies in the face of the way computer scientists are trained.

Hồ Chí Minh) nêu quan điểm: Công ty Bitcoin Việt Nam đã được ra mắt từ cách đây 4 tháng và Công ty TNHH Bitcoin Việt Nam tin rằng đến nay Cục Cảnh sát phòng chống Tội phạm Công nghệ cao (C50) Bộ Công an đã hoàn toàn biết rõ về công ty. Thậm chí, Công ty Bitcoin Việt Nam đang trong quá trình giúp các cơ quan quản lý tìm hiểu rõ hơn về Bitcoin và những ảnh hưởng quan trọng của Bitcoin.Như ICTnews đã đưa , ngày 11/7/2014, ngay sau khi ICTnews đăng thông tin sàn giao dịch Bitcoin đầu tiên tại Việt Nam là VBTC đã chính thức ra mắt (địa chỉ www.vbtc.vn), ông Bùi Quang Tiên, Vụ trưởng Vụ Thanh toán, Ngân hàng Nhà nước đã tỏ ra rất bức xúc và khẳng định sẽ “báo công an bắt những người vận hành sàn giao dịch”.Thông tin phản hồi từ Công ty TNHH Bitcoin Việt Nam nêu rõ: “Công ty đánh giá cao cách tiếp cận cởi mở và tầm nhìn xa của những người lãnh đạo và mong muốn tiếp tục các cuộc thảo luận để giúp họ xây dựng được khung pháp lý đối với Bitcoin tại Việt Nam. Ông Bùi Quang Tiên là một chuyên gia về lĩnh vực Thanh toán trong Ngân hàng Nhà nước nhưng dường như chưa tìm hiểu kỹ về khung pháp lý hiện hành đối với Bitcoin. Thay vì tìm hiểu Bitcoin và đưa ra các dẫn chứng luật thuyết phục, ông đã đe dọa công ty một cách không cần thiết. Trong khi các quan chức Chính phủ đang tìm cách thúc đẩy thương mại quốc tế thì việc làm của ông đang đe dọa những nỗ lực này khi tìm cách gây khó khăn tới những công nghệ mới như Bitcoin”.Phía Bitcoin Việt Nam còn cho rằng, trong khi chính phủ Thái Lan cho phép sàn giao dịch Bitcoin hoạt động trở lại, chính phủ Nhật bảo trợ hiệp hội quản lý tiền tệ số, chính phủ Nga dỡ bỏ lệnh cấm Bitcoin, chính phủ Mỹ chuẩn bị phát hành BitLicense, chính phủ Singapore cho phép Bitcoin tự do nảy nở... thì việc làm của ông Tiên “sẽ làm cho nền kinh tế Việt Nam luôn đi sau khu vực trong thương mại điện tử”.Cũng trong nội dung thông tin phản hồi gửi đến ICTnews, công ty Bitcoin Việt Nam còn trao đổi thêm: ""Bitcoin Việt Nam tự hào nằm trong nhóm khởi nghiệp công nghệ. Chúng tôi hiểu rõ những khó khăn sẽ vấp phải khi số đông ban đầu sẽ tỏ ra nghi ngờ với những công nghệ mới lạ. Tuy nhiên, chúng tôi tin rằng Bitcoin sẽ mang lại rất nhiều lợi ích tốt đẹp tới Việt Nam. Thay vì cấm các doanh nghiệp Bitcoin hoạt động và để cho Bitcoin hoạt động ngầm ngoài tầm kiểm soát, chúng tôi tin rằng một khung luật lệ hợp lý cho Bitcoin sẽ thúc đẩy thương mại điện tử, xuất khẩu hàng hoá, mang lại lợi ích thuế và đẩy xa những giao dịch bất hợp pháp. Bitcoin Việt Nam sẽ luôn tuân thủ mọi yêu cầu pháp lý liên quan đến giao dịch Bitcoin khi Chính phủ đề xuất"".', ""Mise à jour : Nous avons pu nous procurer l'intégralité du rapport Tracfin sur l'encadrement des monnaies virtuelles remis ce midi à Michel Sapin. Nous avons donc mis à jour cette actualité avec les nouvelles informations à notre disposition.Alors que la remise du rapport de Tracfin sur la régulation des monnaies virtuelles est attendue pour ce midi au ministère des finances, nos confrères du Monde en révèlent déjà quelques morceaux choisis. À première vue, il n'est pas question de museler l'utilisation de ces monnaies, mais plutôt de poser certaines règles, finalement assez peu contraignantes.Crédits : Tsokur/iStock/ThinkstockL'ensemble des dispositions concernant le rapport remis par la cellule Tracfin de la Banque de France (Traitement du renseignement et action contre les circuits financiers clandestins) devrait être connu ce midi, lors de sa remise à Michel Sapin au ministère des Finances. Ce rapport doit poser les bases du cadre légal concernant l'utilisation des crypto-monnaies en France, mais également concernant leur fiscalité. Si à l'heure actuelle rien n'est interdit, un certain flou règne et cela peut être un frein à l'adoption par le grand public et les commerçants.Interrogé par nos confrères du Monde, qui ont pu se procurer le rapport, Michel Sapin confirme qu'il n'est pas dans ses objectifs de tout barricader. « Les monnaies virtuelles sont une réalité, même s'il ne faut pas la grossir car il ne s'agit pas de montants susceptibles de déstabiliser le système financier. Elles ont d'abord un intérêt pratique car elles offrent des possibilités de transactions à coût plus faible que les services de paiement classiques. Elles offrent également une alternative aux consommateurs, une autre philosophie de l'échange, moins institutionnel. C'est un modèle que je respecte, et qui repose sur une capacité d'innovation qu'il faut promouvoir. Pour ce faire, le système doit être régulé, au bon sens du terme, sans jugement de valeur. Réguler n'est pas museler », explique-t-il.L'anonymat pose problèmeL'un des avantages des crypto-monnaies concerne le fait qu'un portefeuille en bitcoin (ou dans n'importe quelle autre unité de compte), n'est pas relié directement à une identité. De ce fait, s'il est possible en trois clics de savoir quels montants ont transité sur tel ou tel portefeuille, dans la plupart des cas il est bien plus compliqué de faire le lien avec une personne physique ou morale.Pour résoudre ce problème, le gouvernement compte s'appuyer sur les plateformes d'échange. Celles-ci doivent déjà se déclarer auprès de l'ACPR afin d'obtenir un agrément puisqu'elles proposent des services bancaires. En effet, elles stockent de la monnaie fiduciaire appartenant à leurs clients, ce qui est la définition même d'une activité bancaire. Or, cette dernière est soumise à un cadre assez strict. Ces plateformes devront désormais permettre l'identification de leurs clients, lorsqu'ils effectuent des échanges entre euros et monnaies virtuelles.Ce relatif anonymat, semblable à celui que propose un paiement en espèces posant problème, Tracfin propose également que les montants utilisés lors d'une transaction en bitcoin soient soumis à un plafond qu'il faut encore définir. Dans le cas d'un règlement en espèces, il est de 3 000 euros.Pas de TVA, mais un assujettissement à l'impôtL'une des bonnes nouvelles à retenir concerne le non-assujettissement des monnaies virtuelles à la TVA. Ainsi, si vous en achetez sur une plateforme agréée, vous n'aurez pas à payer 20 % de plus. Par contre,« les plus-values seront imposables au titre des bénéfices industriels et commerciaux (BIC) ou au titre des bénéfices non commerciaux (BNC), selon que l'activité d'achat et de revente est effectuée ou non de façon régulière et professionnelle », annonce Michel Sapin à nos confrères.De même, les crypto-monnaies seront considérées comme faisant partie du patrimoine du contribuable, et devront être déclarées dans le cadre de l'impôt sur la fortune. En somme, cela correspond peu ou prou à ce que l'administration fiscale nous avait suggéré il y a quelques mois.Un rapport qui n'est pas dénué de lacunesSi le rapport de Tracfin se veut plutôt complet concernant les risques encourus par les utilisateurs de crypto-monnaies, en expliquant notamment que « les monnaies virtuelles n’ayant pas cours légal, un règlement avec ces dernières n’a pas d’effet libératoire. Le consommateur doit être averti que payer en monnaie virtuelle sur des sites dont il n’est pas certain de la fiabilité représente un risque très élevé. Cela revient à donner des espèces à un inconnu dans la rue contre un produit qu'il s'engage à vous ramener plus tard ». En d'autres termes, le bitcoin n'ayant pas cours légal, toute transaction se fait à vos risques et périls.Pour résoudre une partie de ces difficultés, la solution consiste à faire appel à un tiers de confiance. Or justement, ce type de tiers existe pour faire la passerelle entre les acheteurs et les vendeurs. Des entreprises comme Paymium en France, ou comme BitPay aux États-Unis remplissent ce rôle de la même façon que le ferait PayPal. L'acheteur envoie des bitcoins, le destinataire recevant au choix bitcoins ou monnaie locale. Ce type d'intermédiaire limite quelque peu les risques d'arnaque, même si comme lors de tout achat en ligne la prudence reste de mise. Chose que le rapport ne précise pas, ce qui est plutot dommage, étant donné que certains services de ce type ont obtenu un agrément de l'ACPR.Mais si les monnaies virtuelles sont pointées du doigt pour leur risque, on regrettera surtout que le rapport n'apporte aucune recommandation à l'État sur l'information qu'il doit apporter aux contribuables à ce sujet, ce qui est plutôt dommage. Il n'est pas non plus question de la qualification juridique de ces « monnaies ». Le rapport se contente d'en apporter une définition s'appuyant sur des textes existants, pour déduire qu'elles ne rentrent dans aucune des cases existantes. Faute de mieux, il ne leur concède que une valeur conventionnelle et privée, comme le ferait un contrat entre personnes.« La monnaie virtuelle ne représentant pas une créance sur l’émetteur et n’étant pas émise contre la remise de fonds, au sens de la directive monnaie électronique 2 (DME2), la qualification de monnaie électronique ne peut être retenue, en l’état des textes. Les monnaies virtuelles ne sont également pas des instruments de paiement tels que définis par le c) de l’article L. 133‐4 du code monétaire et financier. Néanmoins elles peuvent en remplir la fonction économique, sur une base conventionnelle et privée. Les monnaies virtuelles n’entrent également dans aucune des catégories des instruments financiers telles que définies par l’article L. 211‐1 du code monétaire et financier. »Le rapport ne préconise pas davantage la création d'un nouveau statut juridique particulier, ni même d'adosser les monnaies virtuelles à un autre régime. Il conseille cependant au gouvernement d'étudier la question de façon progressive, le secteur évoluant très rapidement. Une démarche prudente et un rapport qui n'apporte finamement qu'une vision anxyogène. Ce choix se comprend aisément, compte tenu de l'origine du rapport - TracFin lutte contre les circuits financiers clandestins, le blanchiment d’argent et le financement du terrorisme - mais les autres partisans des cryptomonnaies pourront néanmoins le regretter...""]","[""For some, Bitcoin doesn't go far enough towards truly unregulated, untraceable currency.

What\'s this Google thing or this Yahoo thing? Some of these people are actually being prevented from looking at some of this information. Then it doesn\'t look like a move forward. This is not evolution because these people are losing the ability to be creative.”After discovering these flaws, “this intelligent being from outer space would probably just be very depressed”, he added.When considering the world from afar, with nature, neurons and ants all considered, for Irvine, decentralization forms a point of view and also a catalyst for change.Ants image via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Hồ Chí Minh) nêu quan điểm: Công ty Bitcoin Việt Nam đã được ra mắt từ cách đây 4 tháng và Công ty TNHH Bitcoin Việt Nam tin rằng đến nay Cục Cảnh sát phòng chống Tội phạm Công nghệ cao (C50) Bộ Công an đã hoàn toàn biết rõ về công ty. Thậm chí, Công ty Bitcoin Việt Nam đang trong quá trình giúp các cơ quan quản lý tìm hiểu rõ hơn về Bitcoin và những ảnh hưởng quan trọng của Bitcoin.Như ICTnews đã đưa , ngày 11/7/2014, ngay sau khi ICTnews đăng thông tin sàn giao dịch Bitcoin đầu tiên tại Việt Nam là VBTC đã chính thức ra mắt (địa chỉ www.vbtc.vn), ông Bùi Quang Tiên, Vụ trưởng Vụ Thanh toán, Ngân hàng Nhà nước đã tỏ ra rất bức xúc và khẳng định sẽ “báo công an bắt những người vận hành sàn giao dịch”.Thông tin phản hồi từ Công ty TNHH Bitcoin Việt Nam nêu rõ: “Công ty đánh giá cao cách tiếp cận cởi mở và tầm nhìn xa của những người lãnh đạo và mong muốn tiếp tục các cuộc thảo luận để giúp họ xây dựng được khung pháp lý đối với Bitcoin tại Việt Nam. Ông Bùi Quang Tiên là một chuyên gia về lĩnh vực Thanh toán trong Ngân hàng Nhà nước nhưng dường như chưa tìm hiểu kỹ về khung pháp lý hiện hành đối với Bitcoin. Thay vì tìm hiểu Bitcoin và đưa ra các dẫn chứng luật thuyết phục, ông đã đe dọa công ty một cách không cần thiết. Trong khi các quan chức Chính phủ đang tìm cách thúc đẩy thương mại quốc tế thì việc làm của ông đang đe dọa những nỗ lực này khi tìm cách gây khó khăn tới những công nghệ mới như Bitcoin”.Phía Bitcoin Việt Nam còn cho rằng, trong khi chính phủ Thái Lan cho phép sàn giao dịch Bitcoin hoạt động trở lại, chính phủ Nhật bảo trợ hiệp hội quản lý tiền tệ số, chính phủ Nga dỡ bỏ lệnh cấm Bitcoin, chính phủ Mỹ chuẩn bị phát hành BitLicense, chính phủ Singapore cho phép Bitcoin tự do nảy nở... thì việc làm của ông Tiên “sẽ làm cho nền kinh tế Việt Nam luôn đi sau khu vực trong thương mại điện tử”.Cũng trong nội dung thông tin phản hồi gửi đến ICTnews, công ty Bitcoin Việt Nam còn trao đổi thêm: ""Bitcoin Việt Nam tự hào nằm trong nhóm khởi nghiệp công nghệ. Chúng tôi hiểu rõ những khó khăn sẽ vấp phải khi số đông ban đầu sẽ tỏ ra nghi ngờ với những công nghệ mới lạ. Tuy nhiên, chúng tôi tin rằng Bitcoin sẽ mang lại rất nhiều lợi ích tốt đẹp tới Việt Nam. Thay vì cấm các doanh nghiệp Bitcoin hoạt động và để cho Bitcoin hoạt động ngầm ngoài tầm kiểm soát, chúng tôi tin rằng một khung luật lệ hợp lý cho Bitcoin sẽ thúc đẩy thương mại điện tử, xuất khẩu hàng hoá, mang lại lợi ích thuế và đẩy xa những giao dịch bất hợp pháp. Bitcoin Việt Nam sẽ luôn tuân thủ mọi yêu cầu pháp lý liên quan đến giao dịch Bitcoin khi Chính phủ đề xuất"".', ""Mise à jour : Nous avons pu nous procurer l'intégralité du rapport Tracfin sur l'encadrement des monnaies virtuelles remis ce midi à Michel Sapin. Nous avons donc mis à jour cette actualité avec les nouvelles informations à notre disposition.Alors que la remise du rapport de Tracfin sur la régulation des monnaies virtuelles est attendue pour ce midi au ministère des finances, nos confrères du Monde en révèlent déjà quelques morceaux choisis. À première vue, il n'est pas question de museler l'utilisation de ces monnaies, mais plutôt de poser certaines règles, finalement assez peu contraignantes.Crédits : Tsokur/iStock/ThinkstockL'ensemble des dispositions concernant le rapport remis par la cellule Tracfin de la Banque de France (Traitement du renseignement et action contre les circuits financiers clandestins) devrait être connu ce midi, lors de sa remise à Michel Sapin au ministère des Finances. Ce rapport doit poser les bases du cadre légal concernant l'utilisation des crypto-monnaies en France, mais également concernant leur fiscalité. Si à l'heure actuelle rien n'est interdit, un certain flou règne et cela peut être un frein à l'adoption par le grand public et les commerçants.Interrogé par nos confrères du Monde, qui ont pu se procurer le rapport, Michel Sapin confirme qu'il n'est pas dans ses objectifs de tout barricader. « Les monnaies virtuelles sont une réalité, même s'il ne faut pas la grossir car il ne s'agit pas de montants susceptibles de déstabiliser le système financier. Elles ont d'abord un intérêt pratique car elles offrent des possibilités de transactions à coût plus faible que les services de paiement classiques. Elles offrent également une alternative aux consommateurs, une autre philosophie de l'échange, moins institutionnel. C'est un modèle que je respecte, et qui repose sur une capacité d'innovation qu'il faut promouvoir. Pour ce faire, le système doit être régulé, au bon sens du terme, sans jugement de valeur. Réguler n'est pas museler », explique-t-il.L'anonymat pose problèmeL'un des avantages des crypto-monnaies concerne le fait qu'un portefeuille en bitcoin (ou dans n'importe quelle autre unité de compte), n'est pas relié directement à une identité. De ce fait, s'il est possible en trois clics de savoir quels montants ont transité sur tel ou tel portefeuille, dans la plupart des cas il est bien plus compliqué de faire le lien avec une personne physique ou morale.Pour résoudre ce problème, le gouvernement compte s'appuyer sur les plateformes d'échange. Celles-ci doivent déjà se déclarer auprès de l'ACPR afin d'obtenir un agrément puisqu'elles proposent des services bancaires. En effet, elles stockent de la monnaie fiduciaire appartenant à leurs clients, ce qui est la définition même d'une activité bancaire. Or, cette dernière est soumise à un cadre assez strict. Ces plateformes devront désormais permettre l'identification de leurs clients, lorsqu'ils effectuent des échanges entre euros et monnaies virtuelles.Ce relatif anonymat, semblable à celui que propose un paiement en espèces posant problème, Tracfin propose également que les montants utilisés lors d'une transaction en bitcoin soient soumis à un plafond qu'il faut encore définir. Dans le cas d'un règlement en espèces, il est de 3 000 euros.Pas de TVA, mais un assujettissement à l'impôtL'une des bonnes nouvelles à retenir concerne le non-assujettissement des monnaies virtuelles à la TVA. Ainsi, si vous en achetez sur une plateforme agréée, vous n'aurez pas à payer 20 % de plus. Par contre,« les plus-values seront imposables au titre des bénéfices industriels et commerciaux (BIC) ou au titre des bénéfices non commerciaux (BNC), selon que l'activité d'achat et de revente est effectuée ou non de façon régulière et professionnelle », annonce Michel Sapin à nos confrères.De même, les crypto-monnaies seront considérées comme faisant partie du patrimoine du contribuable, et devront être déclarées dans le cadre de l'impôt sur la fortune. En somme, cela correspond peu ou prou à ce que l'administration fiscale nous avait suggéré il y a quelques mois.Un rapport qui n'est pas dénué de lacunesSi le rapport de Tracfin se veut plutôt complet concernant les risques encourus par les utilisateurs de crypto-monnaies, en expliquant notamment que « les monnaies virtuelles n’ayant pas cours légal, un règlement avec ces dernières n’a pas d’effet libératoire. Le consommateur doit être averti que payer en monnaie virtuelle sur des sites dont il n’est pas certain de la fiabilité représente un risque très élevé. Cela revient à donner des espèces à un inconnu dans la rue contre un produit qu'il s'engage à vous ramener plus tard ». En d'autres termes, le bitcoin n'ayant pas cours légal, toute transaction se fait à vos risques et périls.Pour résoudre une partie de ces difficultés, la solution consiste à faire appel à un tiers de confiance. Or justement, ce type de tiers existe pour faire la passerelle entre les acheteurs et les vendeurs. Des entreprises comme Paymium en France, ou comme BitPay aux États-Unis remplissent ce rôle de la même façon que le ferait PayPal. L'acheteur envoie des bitcoins, le destinataire recevant au choix bitcoins ou monnaie locale. Ce type d'intermédiaire limite quelque peu les risques d'arnaque, même si comme lors de tout achat en ligne la prudence reste de mise. Chose que le rapport ne précise pas, ce qui est plutot dommage, étant donné que certains services de ce type ont obtenu un agrément de l'ACPR.Mais si les monnaies virtuelles sont pointées du doigt pour leur risque, on regrettera surtout que le rapport n'apporte aucune recommandation à l'État sur l'information qu'il doit apporter aux contribuables à ce sujet, ce qui est plutôt dommage. Il n'est pas non plus question de la qualification juridique de ces « monnaies ». Le rapport se contente d'en apporter une définition s'appuyant sur des textes existants, pour déduire qu'elles ne rentrent dans aucune des cases existantes. Faute de mieux, il ne leur concède que une valeur conventionnelle et privée, comme le ferait un contrat entre personnes.« La monnaie virtuelle ne représentant pas une créance sur l’émetteur et n’étant pas émise contre la remise de fonds, au sens de la directive monnaie électronique 2 (DME2), la qualification de monnaie électronique ne peut être retenue, en l’état des textes. Les monnaies virtuelles ne sont également pas des instruments de paiement tels que définis par le c) de l’article L. 133‐4 du code monétaire et financier. Néanmoins elles peuvent en remplir la fonction économique, sur une base conventionnelle et privée. Les monnaies virtuelles n’entrent également dans aucune des catégories des instruments financiers telles que définies par l’article L. 211‐1 du code monétaire et financier. »Le rapport ne préconise pas davantage la création d'un nouveau statut juridique particulier, ni même d'adosser les monnaies virtuelles à un autre régime. Il conseille cependant au gouvernement d'étudier la question de façon progressive, le secteur évoluant très rapidement. Une démarche prudente et un rapport qui n'apporte finamement qu'une vision anxyogène. Ce choix se comprend aisément, compte tenu de l'origine du rapport - TracFin lutte contre les circuits financiers clandestins, le blanchiment d’argent et le financement du terrorisme - mais les autres partisans des cryptomonnaies pourront néanmoins le regretter...""]"

As part of the deal, CryptVision will become the exclusive provider of BitXatms in the US and Canada.Sergey Yesayan, president of CryptVision, framed the move as one that will find the new company moving quickly to gain a foothold in the bitcoin market, saying:""In terms of positioning our products all over the country, we\'re planning to have most of them in place by the end of the year, and are looking for location partners in shopping malls, restaurants and night clubs.""Yesayan said that the bitcoin ATM units will be available for free to qualified operators, with the qualification process for operators beginning 25th July. CryptVision plans to treat the units as vending machines and manage the associated financial responsibilities and licensing.The announcement follows BitXatm\'s May upgrade to its Sumo Pro ATM product, and was issued at The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC), a two-day community event being held in downtown Chicago.BitXatm courts US marketLaunched in April of this year, BitXatm\'s signature unit – the Sumo Pro – now provides one-way or two-way transaction capabilities in addition to its POS features. The units were on full display at the TNABC, in the country where the company aims to better cater to its biggest market.Marcel Bruck, sales director at BitXatm, told CoinDesk:""US is the number one market. Bitcoin is erupting and you see that most of our customers are also from America. In Europe, you still have a lot of regulations.""BitXatms can accept and dispense any digital currency and offers a web-based back end that allows operators to manage profits, cash flow and to change settings on the ATM remotely.The company said it will continue to provide support for its ATMs to CryptVision once the units are deployed.TNABC announcements continueThe BitXatm announcement is the latest in a string of major news stemming from the NABC event this weekend.Spurred by the launch of new bitcoin lobbying group, the Digital Chamber of Commerce, day one of the conference included major announcements from bitcoin wallet and block explorer provider Blockchain and China-based digital currency exchange OKCoin.To catch up on day one of the NABC, read our full recap here.

That its total bitcoin transactions have been few since it began offering them in December doesn’t faze co-founder Daniel Heyman. Money movement, he told CoinDesk, is the main opportunity in bitcoin – not consumption.Evidence of bitcoin’s transformative possibilities may be traceable across the continent. South Africa and Kenya certainly have well-established bitcoin economies that continue to progress. But so far, nothing on their level exists in West Africa.Heyman said that stability and peace across the western region is at an all time high, and that makes prospects rosier for Bureh’s business and its possible role in the bitcoin ecosystem. He said:“I personally am a big believer in the potential of bitcoin to leapfrog the existing financial infrastructure across sub-Saharan Africa. I'm not sure how quickly this will happen but in five years per se I could see a world where everyone has a bitcoin account tied to a cell phone, even in northern Sierra Leone where our fabrics are made. I could place orders from New York – which I do already – and also make payments.”Business operationsBureh launched in 2011. Its accessories are hand-produced in Sierra Leone by well-paid local artisans, said Heyman, and made from traditional fabrics sourced by local businessmen and entrepreneurs. The collection is distributed in Sierra Leone, the US, Europe and China, where it showed this April at Shanghai Fashion Week exhibition. The company, Heyman said, reinvests half of its profits into start-up companies in West Africa to promote entrepreneurship.Heyman, who oversees his company from New York, said that the business is less susceptible to foreign exchange risk than most. “But our people, our employees, and our contractors are not,” he continued.When the Sierra Leonean Leone (SLL) weakens against the dollar, Bureh as a business isn’t at risk, as its revenue is mostly in foreign currency, he explained, but that means everyone supplying services to the company suffers.He said:“BitPesa in Kenya is an example of the sort of service we would love in West Africa. If we could send money straight to our management team and even employees in Sierra Leone – with lower costs and fewer delays – that would really improve our responsiveness and our ability to manage complex organizations.”Bureh pays fixed fees when it wires money from the US, said Heyman, but Sierra Leone banks automatically convert US$ into SLL. No specific figures were provided in this interview.“This is where the majority of the fees are hidden,” he said, “and it's hard to say exactly how much. Unlicensed exchangers offer rates that are regularly five to 8% better.”Looking to KenyaBitPesa, the bitcoin remittance service, and mobile money transfer service M-Pesa, are valuable because they eliminate the risk and uncertainty of fees, conversion rates, speed and fraud.The global remittances industry is now worth over $500bn a year. In 2012, remittances to Africa alone were estimated at around $60bn.Heyman said that West Africa has a long way to go if it's going to catch up to Kenya in mobile banking, but that progress is rising throughout the region.He added:“I'm not sure Bureh will ever be a major player in the bitcoin space, but at this point we are big believers in its potential to make it easier to conduct business across borders and in places with underdeveloped banking systems.”Image via BurehThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

A new term is starting to pop up in conversations in the business community – “the Montreal effect”. Canada’s largely francophone province of Quebec held an independence referendum in 1980 and another in 1995. The uncertainty around its “neverendum” had a chilling effect on Montreal’s status as a corporate hub, says Colin Mason, a professor at the University of Glasgow’s Adam Smith Business School. He says 30 companies, including the Bank of Montreal, moved their headquarters from Montreal to Toronto between 1978 and 1981. The number of Canada’s top 500 companies by revenue with their head offices in Montreal fell from 96 to 75 between 1990 and 2011. Could the same thing happen in Scotland? Quebec’s situation differs in many ways – not least because language has played a much bigger role there. But Brad MacKay, a professor at the University of Edinburgh Business School, says the risk of a “Montreal effect” cannot be ruled out. “Businesses gravitate towards certainty,” he said. “I think if there was a No vote and the Scottish government said, ‘OK, we’re now just going to get on with it,’ then probably you would not get the ‘Montreal effect’. “If, on the other hand, you got a fair amount of animosity and you had the nationalists say, ‘We’ll give it a decade and have another go,’ then I think .\u2009.\u2009. inevitably you would start to see some businesses move out.” Sign up to the daily FT UK Politics email One-Click Sign Up  to FT UK Politics']","['Germany-based digital currency bitcoin ATM and point-of-sale (POS) solution provider BitXatm has announced a new partnership that will find the company shipping 1,000 units to the US in a bid to build the country\'s largest bitcoin ATM network.For the initiative, BitXatm will partner with Los Angeles-based CryptVision, a startup that itself is seeking to build the largest network of bitcoin ATMs around the globe.

07/26/2014,"[""Charles Allen is the CEO of Bitcoin Shop, a publicly traded US bitcoin company that leverages Amazon's affiliate program to sell a wide selection of e-commerce products for bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin.Bitcoin Shop is now seeking to expand its industry goals, recently making strategic investments in key partners, including California-based bitcoin buying service expresscoin and digital currency processor GoCoin, with the goal of using e-commerce to build a universal bitcoin company.Allen recently spoke about his company's ambitions at The North American Bitcoin Conference, held last weekend at Chicago's McCormick Place convention center. CoinDesk sat down with Allen to learn more about his company, the pressures of being public and why he believes Bitcoin Shop is the most misunderstood company in the space.CoinDesk: You've said that Bitcoin Shop is one of the more misunderstood companies in the bitcoin industry, and that you're not simply an e-commerce play. Can you introduce us to your vision for Bitcoin Shop and its goals?Charles Allen: Yeah, that's not what we're building. Just to give you an idea where we started, the company was founded by two engineers from NASA in June last year. We launched our initial website in September and basically realized that there are bitcoins, but nowhere to spend them. That's not a business, that's a short-term solution to a problem. No one accepts bitcoins, now there's someone to do it. That's not sustainable. I joined in January and have shifted the direction of the company.In February, we were a lead investor in GoCoin, and we use them as a payment processor, so we now accept bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin. We also just invested in expresscoin. What we want to do is use digital currency as an onramp to digital currency adoption, and the first step in that is redoing the website. Everyone was part-time until February and we haven't touched the website since going public.We need to be able to take bitcoin out of the equation and that e-commerce model needs to be a standalone business.No one's ever done this before [...] Conceptually you could shop from all the big-box retailers you trust and we would find you the best price and they would ship it to you.We believe if we create a solution where we connected to all these people, there's a good reason people should shop on our site as opposed to [just] bitcoin.Do you see Bitcoin Shop evolving to become more of a traditional e-commerce company, and less focused on bitcoin, over time?You're still thinking about e-commerce as the core of the business, and it is now, but we want to tie all the other service offerings in. If you think about it, it doesn't make sense to have a wallet that isn't integrated with a payment processor or that isn't integrated with a merchant. It's not all tied together. You need a universal solution, then a customer can have one point of access and do all their transactions.If you have a wallet, now you have to connect your wallet to your exchange or your payment processor. You have all these different usernames and passwords and logins, and you're building this ecosystem of different providers that you have to manage and deal with.We believe that we can create a unified solution through partnerships, where you can do everything in one stop, where you can shop and exchange, and you could buy products, you can get bitcoin, collecting all of the pieces, but e-commerce is the onramp.The nice thing about e-commerce: business models are unproven at bitcoin companies. If you're a wallet, how are you going to make money? Should a wallet be a free service that's offered by a company?If you start thinking about all these pieces its very difficult to transact and work in bitcoin, because no one has come out with a very elegant solution. Coinbase has done a very good job, and the fact that they have an ACH [Automated Clearing House] relationship, so they can connect to your bank account, is a great lead, but it's not a long-term competitive advantage.E-commerce is nice because no one is going to complain about us getting affiliate fees from the merchants we purchase from, whereas people may complain about paying for a wallet service, so a lot of the models that are being built are just untested. What is a consumer willing to pay for versus what are they not willing to pay for?So you see Bitcoin Shop and its partner ecosystem becoming like a Coinbase, Circle-type consumer solution?Yes, our investing in expresscoin is the step in that direction. They don't have the ACH connection, but they're connected to ATMs, they can wire money in, they have agents. But to be able to seamlessly offer that for our website is where I want to go.We've raised just under $2m, so we're partnering with other companies in the space that we believe we can connect with to offer a seamless solution over time. Right now the core team is putting the new website out the door and once that's done we're going to work to integrate expresscoin.Our competitive advantage today is that we're the only public company in this space.I know you've said that an advantage to investing in Bitcoin Shop is the exposure investors get to companies like expresscoin and GoCoin. Do you see Bitcoin Shop becoming almost like an exchange-traded fund for investors?I would say it's more like a public private equity fund or like a BT6 [equity fund]. So right now, you're right. For investors in our company, we trade anywhere from $400,000-$500,000 a day in stock. So, if you bought $10,000 worth of stock you could sell that quite easily at current volumes. When you think about for the general public, if you want to be exposed to bitcoin, you can buy bitcoin or you can buy my stock.If you buy my stock, you get exposed to GoCoin and expresscoin, and we have an option to invest $1m in expresscoin at its current valuation. I'm not looking to be a publically traded fund; the investments I've made to date are strategic because I want to integrate with these companies.For now, Bitcoin Shop is still an e-commerce company. How affected are you by new merchants that enter the bitcoin ecosystem? Is good merchant news for bitcoin bad for Bitcoin Shop?I think it's a positive in that the more big merchants come on, the more people want bitcoin. I think most of the merchants coming online are doing it because it's free PR.Dell accepts bitcoin. I'm sure they'll talk to you or be on Bloomberg. They can be in the media to drive awareness and their customer acquisition [costs] are lower, which is great. The more adoption there is, the more its going to force regulators to make decisions.Do you feel like Bitcoin Shop will need to rebrand in order to better communicate its goals of becoming a universal bitcoin company?You'll notice we bought BTCS.com. That's our stock ticker, so there may be a point where we'll think about rebranding when the time is right. Right now, I think it needs to be reflective of the business model we have in place.This interview has been edited for length.Image via BloombergThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

This is used as a warning to avoid over-investing in Bitcoin as well as a way to communicate the message not to store an entire fortune in a single wallet. Coinbase, a leading online wallet provider, wants to make storage simpler.Why is another option needed?The default state of Bitcoin is to be within a “wallet.” A given sum of bitcoins will be associated with an address, of which any user of Bitcoin can have an unlimited amount of. Much like real wallets, you want to keep some bitcoins in an everyday use wallet for easy access.Just like your real wallet, though, you probably don’t want your entire savings in that wallet. You could become a target for theft if anyone knew and the consequences of losing your wallet are too dear. Instead, many people trust a bank for larger amounts of money.Coinbase Vault offers a similar option for Bitcoin owners. Unlike fiat currency (like USD), bitcoins can be irrevocably stolen by a computer hacking attack. Likewise, the public ledger system that keeps Bitcoin fraud from occurring makes a given wallet address’s balance public knowledge.So if I posted an address for donations on GeekSided and I had 5 BTC (worth around $3000 USD at the time of publishing) in that address (verifiable by checking the block chain), I’ve provided sufficient public information to become a target for thieves online. While 5 BTC may not attract the most sophisticated thieves, you get the idea; people will see if I have made obvious security mistakes.For this reason, a practice called “cold storage” has become common among people protecting larger amounts of Bitcoin. This means that the wallet is accessed via software only on a computer or other device that has no Internet connection and never has connected to the Internet. This provides absolute assurance that there are no keyloggers, man-in-the-middle attackers, or anything else jeopardizing the security of the wallet.Coinbase Vault tries to bridge the gap between novices and Bitcoin securityCoinbase Vault is trying to offer this service without requiring customers to have the expertise required to set up cold storage on their own. By default, any Bitcoin currency exchange service like Coinbase needs to do this with their own bitcoins to avoid theft. For instance, it is believed an enormous heist may be responsible for the collapse of Mt. Gox, the one-time largest Bitcoin exchange.Vault provides several features to try to prevent fraud as well as prevent attacks on Coinbase.Two-factor authentication by default, with additional factors allowed.48-hour delay before withdrawals are processed.Like Coinbase’s own holdings, 97% are stored in cold storage in various geographic locations.Accounts can be held jointly, requiring the approval of multiple people before withdrawals are processed.For now, at least, this service is free. While this isn’t as secure as a savvy person setting up their own storage – the fact that it is set up online means there is a vulnerability upfront as the account is created – it appears to be a solid option for those without the acumen or desire to take these measures on their own.It reflects a further maturing Bitcoin market, as financial services like Coinbase offer comparable services to what is available for fiat currency.', 'The world is moving toward a paper-free financial system, but in the borderline-legal organizations of the world’s underbelly economy, cash still reigns as king.Any good business owner is keen to please his or her customers, particularly when it comes to prostitution. To avoid the awkward fumble of cash after a lusty romp, the frictionless convenience of digital payment systems is becoming more attractive.How long before sex workers and escort services in the US and Europe start accepting payments via services like Venmo and PayPal, and currencies such as Bitcoin, instead of cash?The business of sexWhile the sex industry may be the world’s oldest profession, the internet has done well to disrupt it. Prostitutes and escort services in the Western world have taken their business online, using sites like Facebook, Craigslist and Backpage to advertise instead of street corners.In New York, appointments with call girls and escort agent employees are often arranged online, and digital transactions have become more common.When PayPal opened its virtual doors in 2001, some of its first customers were those working in the sex industry. But in recent years, the eBay owned company has been noticeably cracking down. Any website promoting prostitution or pornography with a recognizable “Pay Now” button is at high risk of having its accounts closed and assets frozen.According to a representative of SWOP Chicago, a grassroots organization dedicated to improving the lives of current and former sex workers in the Chicago area, PayPal is notoriously opposed to the sex industry. She says that many people she knows have had their accounts disabled because PayPal found out about their business. And if this happens when there is still money in the account, she says PayPal won’t release the funds.As an alternative, she points out that prepaid MasterCard and Visa gift cards are becoming more popular. But even still, companies such as Green Dot have recently come down on the industry as well, shutting down accounts due to “suspicious” charges.Transactions are traceablePeter*, a 26-year old Brit living in NYC, says he is too fearful of using services like PayPal in case he were ever found out.“It’s an illegal activity,” says Peter, who works at a record label. “If they were ever busted, that transaction could be traced back to me.”Even those who are tech-savvy shy from using the most basic form of digital payment.“I’ve never seen a prostitute take PayPal, Bitcoin, Venmo or Square but I have been asked if I want to use a credit card,” says William*, a 29-year old founder of a dating app. “But I would never use a card, I don’t need AMEX knowing I go to an Asian spa on 3rd Avenue every so often!”William says he uses cash 100 percent of the time, although he would use Bitcoin if it were on offer. “It would make me a lot more comfortable if they took any form of cryptocurrency that is semi-anonymous,” he says. “It feels dirty passing cash at the end of our time together.”While William says he was expecting to see digital payments on offer in Amsterdam’s Red Light District, he says it’s still a cash-first business there, too. He notes that rates for prostitution start at €50 ($67) compared to $200 in the US.Starting on March 20, 2014, Amsterdam’s Bitcoin Boulevard opened up an entire street of commerce to Bitcoin payments.CoinDesk reports that while it was a hard sell at first, many of the restaurant owners started seeing the advantages of Bitcoin – such as the low transaction costs, the ease of payment for international guests and the promotional value.If this takes off, perhaps it’s just a matter of time before Bitcoin Boulevard’s influence reaches Amsterdam’s Red Light District.Meanwhile in central London…Ellen Malloy, a wife and mother of a newborn, says that she encourages her partner Michael* to visit prostitutes. “I will spare you the gory details but he picks up tips from the experts that he brings home to the boudoir,” she says.Michael says that when possible, he prefers to make payments two to four days in advance via PayPal before any assignation with prostitutes.“It is a more practical and less awkward way of doing business than handing over cash at the end,” explains Ellen. “More sex workers are adopting this transaction method, which I approve of.”In the UK, while brothels are against the law, the exchange of sexual services for money as well as ‘escort’ agencies are actually legal. And north-west of London in Birmingham, they are even taking Bitcoin and Litecoin.Last year, Passion VIP, billed as the world’s first Bitcoin escort agency, emerged. After booking an appointment time, clients can send payment via Passion VIP’s “Bitcoin Escorts” page.Once the payment is processed, Passion VIP confirms the appointment, eliminating any stress around payment, theft or counterfeit on either side of the transaction. The cost for one hour of a “Standard” lady’s time is 1.711 BTC, which at current Bitcoin exchange rates will cost you around $1,030.For many sex workers, digital payment options have made transactions fast, straightforward and discreet. But payment methods such as PayPal, Square or any credit card means there will be a record. And given the fact that, legal or not, at the end of the day, prostitution is something that most husbands, wives, families, girlfriends and members of the general population are not particularly fond of, cash is still the most popular way to pay for items off the books.For the sex industry, PayPal and Venmo will never replace cash. But cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Litcoin that offer anonymity just might.*All names were changed for this article.Top image credit: Flickr/Alejandro Forero CuervoRead next: Why it might be time for Twitter to start filtering your feed', ""© REUTERS Een bitcoinmachine waar mensen hun saldo konden opladen heeft in Arnhem maar kort gefunctioneerd. Nu worden in kroegen en restaurants nog 'enkele transacties per dag' gedaan.Spektakel voorbijHoe het daarmee gaat? Het spektakel is alweer voorbij, zegt initiatiefnemer Henk van Tijen. 'De exploitant heeft de automaten teruggehaald omdat de omzet te laag was. In totaal minder dan 5.000 euro, hoorde ik.'De plek hier is niet optimaal. De kade is een rustig grachtje waar overdag niet veel mensen langskomen. Je moet hem neerzetten op drukke plaatsen, zoals stations of een luchthaven.'In de twee maanden dat de Bierkade 'into bitcoin' was, is ongeveer 700 keer met de digitale munt afgerekend. Ondernemers waren er minder blij mee dan gedacht. Na sluitingstijd moesten ze hun opbrengst weer snel terugwisselen voor euro's, vanwege de kans op koersverliezen. Binnenkort wordt niettemin een nieuwe machine geplaatst; in eetcafé Werelds.'Strikt genomen is het niet zo logisch om met bitcoins te betalen', erkent Van Tijen. 'Nederland heeft veel betalingsmogelijkheden, zoals pinnen en ons unieke Ideal-systeem. Op andere plaatsen in de wereld hebben mensen soms niet eens een bankrekening. Daar zie ik wel veel kansen.'Een van de twee Haagse automaten is teruggegaan naar Zwitserland. De andere werd gekocht door Robert-Reinder Nederhoed, eigenaar van de digitale bitcoinbeurs Bitmymoney. Die zette hem neer in Stadscafé De Waag, waar hij dus sporadisch wordt gebruikt.Eind mei was het de beurt aan Arnhem, dat werd uitgeroepen tot 'Bitcoinstad'. Vijftien ondernemers deden aan het initiatief mee. Op één dag deden zeventig mensen 96 betalingen met een omzet van 4,2 bitcoin; op dat moment omgerekend 1.977 euro.Dat niveau is sindsdien nooit meer geëvenaard, mijmert organisator Patrick van der Meijde. 'Maar de ondernemers zijn nog wel enthousiast. We hebben een beter systeem gebouwd dan in Den Haag, waardoor we kunnen garanderen dat wanneer klanten afrekenen voor omgerekend 20 euro er ook echt 20 euro op hun rekening bijkomt.'Enkele transacties per dagEen bitcoinmachine waar mensen hun saldo konden opladen heeft in Arnhem maar kort gefunctioneerd. Nu worden in kroegen en restaurants nog 'enkele transacties per dag' gedaan. Dat is niet indrukwekkend, moet hij toegeven. 'Helaas is de groep gebruikers klein. Weinig mensen weten het. Er komt ook een beetje ideologie bij kijken. Wij enthousiastelingen vinden het vreemd dat het betalingsverkeer volledig in handen is van commerciële banken. Daar staat tegenover dat pinnen in Nederland heel gemakkelijk gaat. Ik verwachten niet dat het hier een booming business zal worden.'Bovendien bestaat de kans dat bitcoins in één week de helft van hun waarde verliezen, zoals eerder is gebeurd. Van der Meijde: 'Ik zou niemand aanraden om zijn hele vermogen in bitcoins te steken. Maar ik denk ook dat de koerswisselingen over twee of drie jaar veel kleiner zullen zijn, zodra het systeem massaler wordt gebruikt.'Vandaag in de Volkskrant: Hij kan zomaar 40.000 dollar waard worden""]","[""Charles Allen is the CEO of Bitcoin Shop, a publicly traded US bitcoin company that leverages Amazon's affiliate program to sell a wide selection of e-commerce products for bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin.Bitcoin Shop is now seeking to expand its industry goals, recently making strategic investments in key partners, including California-based bitcoin buying service expresscoin and digital currency processor GoCoin, with the goal of using e-commerce to build a universal bitcoin company.Allen recently spoke about his company's ambitions at The North American Bitcoin Conference, held last weekend at Chicago's McCormick Place convention center.

Do you see Bitcoin Shop becoming almost like an exchange-traded fund for investors?I would say it's more like a public private equity fund or like a BT6 [equity fund]. So right now, you're right. For investors in our company, we trade anywhere from $400,000-$500,000 a day in stock. So, if you bought $10,000 worth of stock you could sell that quite easily at current volumes. When you think about for the general public, if you want to be exposed to bitcoin, you can buy bitcoin or you can buy my stock.If you buy my stock, you get exposed to GoCoin and expresscoin, and we have an option to invest $1m in expresscoin at its current valuation. I'm not looking to be a publically traded fund; the investments I've made to date are strategic because I want to integrate with these companies.For now, Bitcoin Shop is still an e-commerce company. How affected are you by new merchants that enter the bitcoin ecosystem? Is good merchant news for bitcoin bad for Bitcoin Shop?I think it's a positive in that the more big merchants come on, the more people want bitcoin. I think most of the merchants coming online are doing it because it's free PR.Dell accepts bitcoin. I'm sure they'll talk to you or be on Bloomberg. They can be in the media to drive awareness and their customer acquisition [costs] are lower, which is great. The more adoption there is, the more its going to force regulators to make decisions.Do you feel like Bitcoin Shop will need to rebrand in order to better communicate its goals of becoming a universal bitcoin company?You'll notice we bought BTCS.com. That's our stock ticker, so there may be a point where we'll think about rebranding when the time is right. Right now, I think it needs to be reflective of the business model we have in place.This interview has been edited for length.Image via BloombergThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

This is used as a warning to avoid over-investing in Bitcoin as well as a way to communicate the message not to store an entire fortune in a single wallet. Coinbase, a leading online wallet provider, wants to make storage simpler.Why is another option needed?The default state of Bitcoin is to be within a “wallet.” A given sum of bitcoins will be associated with an address, of which any user of Bitcoin can have an unlimited amount of. Much like real wallets, you want to keep some bitcoins in an everyday use wallet for easy access.Just like your real wallet, though, you probably don’t want your entire savings in that wallet. You could become a target for theft if anyone knew and the consequences of losing your wallet are too dear. Instead, many people trust a bank for larger amounts of money.Coinbase Vault offers a similar option for Bitcoin owners. Unlike fiat currency (like USD), bitcoins can be irrevocably stolen by a computer hacking attack. Likewise, the public ledger system that keeps Bitcoin fraud from occurring makes a given wallet address’s balance public knowledge.So if I posted an address for donations on GeekSided and I had 5 BTC (worth around $3000 USD at the time of publishing) in that address (verifiable by checking the block chain), I’ve provided sufficient public information to become a target for thieves online. While 5 BTC may not attract the most sophisticated thieves, you get the idea; people will see if I have made obvious security mistakes.For this reason, a practice called “cold storage” has become common among people protecting larger amounts of Bitcoin. This means that the wallet is accessed via software only on a computer or other device that has no Internet connection and never has connected to the Internet. This provides absolute assurance that there are no keyloggers, man-in-the-middle attackers, or anything else jeopardizing the security of the wallet.Coinbase Vault tries to bridge the gap between novices and Bitcoin securityCoinbase Vault is trying to offer this service without requiring customers to have the expertise required to set up cold storage on their own. By default, any Bitcoin currency exchange service like Coinbase needs to do this with their own bitcoins to avoid theft. For instance, it is believed an enormous heist may be responsible for the collapse of Mt. Gox, the one-time largest Bitcoin exchange.Vault provides several features to try to prevent fraud as well as prevent attacks on Coinbase.Two-factor authentication by default, with additional factors allowed.48-hour delay before withdrawals are processed.Like Coinbase’s own holdings, 97% are stored in cold storage in various geographic locations.Accounts can be held jointly, requiring the approval of multiple people before withdrawals are processed.For now, at least, this service is free. While this isn’t as secure as a savvy person setting up their own storage – the fact that it is set up online means there is a vulnerability upfront as the account is created – it appears to be a solid option for those without the acumen or desire to take these measures on their own.It reflects a further maturing Bitcoin market, as financial services like Coinbase offer comparable services to what is available for fiat currency.', 'The world is moving toward a paper-free financial system, but in the borderline-legal organizations of the world’s underbelly economy, cash still reigns as king.Any good business owner is keen to please his or her customers, particularly when it comes to prostitution. To avoid the awkward fumble of cash after a lusty romp, the frictionless convenience of digital payment systems is becoming more attractive.How long before sex workers and escort services in the US and Europe start accepting payments via services like Venmo and PayPal, and currencies such as Bitcoin, instead of cash?The business of sexWhile the sex industry may be the world’s oldest profession, the internet has done well to disrupt it. Prostitutes and escort services in the Western world have taken their business online, using sites like Facebook, Craigslist and Backpage to advertise instead of street corners.In New York, appointments with call girls and escort agent employees are often arranged online, and digital transactions have become more common.When PayPal opened its virtual doors in 2001, some of its first customers were those working in the sex industry. But in recent years, the eBay owned company has been noticeably cracking down. Any website promoting prostitution or pornography with a recognizable “Pay Now” button is at high risk of having its accounts closed and assets frozen.According to a representative of SWOP Chicago, a grassroots organization dedicated to improving the lives of current and former sex workers in the Chicago area, PayPal is notoriously opposed to the sex industry. She says that many people she knows have had their accounts disabled because PayPal found out about their business. And if this happens when there is still money in the account, she says PayPal won’t release the funds.As an alternative, she points out that prepaid MasterCard and Visa gift cards are becoming more popular. But even still, companies such as Green Dot have recently come down on the industry as well, shutting down accounts due to “suspicious” charges.Transactions are traceablePeter*, a 26-year old Brit living in NYC, says he is too fearful of using services like PayPal in case he were ever found out.“It’s an illegal activity,” says Peter, who works at a record label. “If they were ever busted, that transaction could be traced back to me.”Even those who are tech-savvy shy from using the most basic form of digital payment.“I’ve never seen a prostitute take PayPal, Bitcoin, Venmo or Square but I have been asked if I want to use a credit card,” says William*, a 29-year old founder of a dating app. “But I would never use a card, I don’t need AMEX knowing I go to an Asian spa on 3rd Avenue every so often!”William says he uses cash 100 percent of the time, although he would use Bitcoin if it were on offer. “It would make me a lot more comfortable if they took any form of cryptocurrency that is semi-anonymous,” he says. “It feels dirty passing cash at the end of our time together.”While William says he was expecting to see digital payments on offer in Amsterdam’s Red Light District, he says it’s still a cash-first business there, too. He notes that rates for prostitution start at €50 ($67) compared to $200 in the US.Starting on March 20, 2014, Amsterdam’s Bitcoin Boulevard opened up an entire street of commerce to Bitcoin payments.CoinDesk reports that while it was a hard sell at first, many of the restaurant owners started seeing the advantages of Bitcoin – such as the low transaction costs, the ease of payment for international guests and the promotional value.If this takes off, perhaps it’s just a matter of time before Bitcoin Boulevard’s influence reaches Amsterdam’s Red Light District.Meanwhile in central London…Ellen Malloy, a wife and mother of a newborn, says that she encourages her partner Michael* to visit prostitutes. “I will spare you the gory details but he picks up tips from the experts that he brings home to the boudoir,” she says.Michael says that when possible, he prefers to make payments two to four days in advance via PayPal before any assignation with prostitutes.“It is a more practical and less awkward way of doing business than handing over cash at the end,” explains Ellen. “More sex workers are adopting this transaction method, which I approve of.”In the UK, while brothels are against the law, the exchange of sexual services for money as well as ‘escort’ agencies are actually legal. And north-west of London in Birmingham, they are even taking Bitcoin and Litecoin.Last year, Passion VIP, billed as the world’s first Bitcoin escort agency, emerged. After booking an appointment time, clients can send payment via Passion VIP’s “Bitcoin Escorts” page.Once the payment is processed, Passion VIP confirms the appointment, eliminating any stress around payment, theft or counterfeit on either side of the transaction. The cost for one hour of a “Standard” lady’s time is 1.711 BTC, which at current Bitcoin exchange rates will cost you around $1,030.For many sex workers, digital payment options have made transactions fast, straightforward and discreet. But payment methods such as PayPal, Square or any credit card means there will be a record. And given the fact that, legal or not, at the end of the day, prostitution is something that most husbands, wives, families, girlfriends and members of the general population are not particularly fond of, cash is still the most popular way to pay for items off the books.For the sex industry, PayPal and Venmo will never replace cash. But cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Litcoin that offer anonymity just might.*All names were changed for this article.Top image credit: Flickr/Alejandro Forero CuervoRead next: Why it might be time for Twitter to start filtering your feed', ""© REUTERS Een bitcoinmachine waar mensen hun saldo konden opladen heeft in Arnhem maar kort gefunctioneerd. Nu worden in kroegen en restaurants nog 'enkele transacties per dag' gedaan.Spektakel voorbijHoe het daarmee gaat? Het spektakel is alweer voorbij, zegt initiatiefnemer Henk van Tijen. 'De exploitant heeft de automaten teruggehaald omdat de omzet te laag was. In totaal minder dan 5.000 euro, hoorde ik.'De plek hier is niet optimaal. De kade is een rustig grachtje waar overdag niet veel mensen langskomen. Je moet hem neerzetten op drukke plaatsen, zoals stations of een luchthaven.'In de twee maanden dat de Bierkade 'into bitcoin' was, is ongeveer 700 keer met de digitale munt afgerekend. Ondernemers waren er minder blij mee dan gedacht. Na sluitingstijd moesten ze hun opbrengst weer snel terugwisselen voor euro's, vanwege de kans op koersverliezen. Binnenkort wordt niettemin een nieuwe machine geplaatst; in eetcafé Werelds.'Strikt genomen is het niet zo logisch om met bitcoins te betalen', erkent Van Tijen. 'Nederland heeft veel betalingsmogelijkheden, zoals pinnen en ons unieke Ideal-systeem. Op andere plaatsen in de wereld hebben mensen soms niet eens een bankrekening. Daar zie ik wel veel kansen.'Een van de twee Haagse automaten is teruggegaan naar Zwitserland. De andere werd gekocht door Robert-Reinder Nederhoed, eigenaar van de digitale bitcoinbeurs Bitmymoney. Die zette hem neer in Stadscafé De Waag, waar hij dus sporadisch wordt gebruikt.Eind mei was het de beurt aan Arnhem, dat werd uitgeroepen tot 'Bitcoinstad'. Vijftien ondernemers deden aan het initiatief mee. Op één dag deden zeventig mensen 96 betalingen met een omzet van 4,2 bitcoin; op dat moment omgerekend 1.977 euro.Dat niveau is sindsdien nooit meer geëvenaard, mijmert organisator Patrick van der Meijde. 'Maar de ondernemers zijn nog wel enthousiast. We hebben een beter systeem gebouwd dan in Den Haag, waardoor we kunnen garanderen dat wanneer klanten afrekenen voor omgerekend 20 euro er ook echt 20 euro op hun rekening bijkomt.'Enkele transacties per dagEen bitcoinmachine waar mensen hun saldo konden opladen heeft in Arnhem maar kort gefunctioneerd. Nu worden in kroegen en restaurants nog 'enkele transacties per dag' gedaan. Dat is niet indrukwekkend, moet hij toegeven. 'Helaas is de groep gebruikers klein. Weinig mensen weten het. Er komt ook een beetje ideologie bij kijken. Wij enthousiastelingen vinden het vreemd dat het betalingsverkeer volledig in handen is van commerciële banken. Daar staat tegenover dat pinnen in Nederland heel gemakkelijk gaat. Ik verwachten niet dat het hier een booming business zal worden.'Bovendien bestaat de kans dat bitcoins in één week de helft van hun waarde verliezen, zoals eerder is gebeurd. Van der Meijde: 'Ik zou niemand aanraden om zijn hele vermogen in bitcoins te steken. Maar ik denk ook dat de koerswisselingen over twee of drie jaar veel kleiner zullen zijn, zodra het systeem massaler wordt gebruikt.'Vandaag in de Volkskrant: Hij kan zomaar 40.000 dollar waard worden""]"

It accepts corporate and individual donations, and counts BitPay, Xapo, LibraTax and Roger Ver among its founding donors.New campaign and membership schemeToday the foundation also launches two new initiatives: the Founding Donors Campaign and a membership program for individuals. Each is open to donors worldwide.The new campaign is aimed at one-shot donations from larger groups or companies to help get the foundation’s activity rolling, whereas the membership program is being offered to individuals on an annual basis to support the underlying operations of the organization.Furthermore, in the following year, the foundation plans to offer an annual component to corporations and larger donors.Bitcoin trustGallippi said that the organization’s long-term functionality is to have the equivalent of a multi-million-dollar investment trust, in bitcoin, from which it can give to causes and projects.“We have the resources, we’re evaluating organizations and providing essentially grants,” Gallippi said. “We want to be doing our mission-based work – that’s the whole point – but, until we have built the ‘endowment’, we have to sort of do it in a different way right now.”That way is by running fundraising campaigns for particular projects. However, having secured 501(c)(3) status, BitGive now has the green light to build that fund.In effect, though, the fund will function like an endowment, in that the incoming donations will rise in value over time and the foundation will be able to sustain itself and provide more charitable giving based on those gains.It won’t be an endowment in the technical sense, Gallippi said, explaining that the bulk of funds from endowments have to sit untouched for some time.“Because we’re so young,” she explained, “we’re testing different models out, but we’re constrained in what we can do because we’re still building up our financial resources.”Where do the donations go?Gallippi said that while the investment trust exists, it isn’t yet large enough yet to be funding projects, so BitGive is currently running individual campaigns too.The organization’s current campaign is for The Water Project, and has a fundraising goal of $10,000 in bitcoin.

A longtime veteran of the precious metals and commodities sector, Castillo, like many people, initially thought bitcoin was silly. So, he chose instead to start a precious metals business, launching Wyoming-based Agora Commodities (now rebranded as Veldt Gold) in 2012.Agora Commodities found success in the industry, accepting credit cards and cash/bank transfers for gold and silver. However, following a conversation with a friend and fellow gold investor, Castillo decided to add bitcoin payments at the end of 2012 to his then-new company.It's a decision that radically changed its future.Revenue earnerBetween that date and the beginning of 2014, Castillo’s decision to accept bitcoin generated about $10m in revenue.“What we had to do to protect ourselves against card fraud, we no longer have to do with bitcoin.”This success later prompted Agora Commodities to move in a more radical direction, deciding to drop credit card payments entirely.Castillo told CoinDesk in an interview that, on the surface, choosing bitcoin over credit cards helped reduce payment costs and the risk of card fraud, the latter of which forms a key concern for gold dealers in the digital age of commerce.Castillo also noted the overall positive reaction by his customers, saying, “[The reaction] was generally supportive. Some customers had questions about bitcoin, but nothing negative. This business is built around trust, and once you have a customer, they’re willing to stay with you because they trust you.”Protecting the businessCastillo said that, as a small business, the dangers of credit card acceptance, such as chargebacks and fraudulent card use – made it relatively easy to drop the payment method entirely.He explained:“What we had to do to protect ourselves against card fraud, we no longer have to do with bitcoin – and that saves us on costs.”Beyond the practical security advantages of shifting away from credit cards, Castillo noted another curious benefit: removing a somewhat ironic payment method. For Castillo, the purchase of gold with credit doesn’t make sense.By comparison, he sees digital currency’s underlying technical characteristics and the intrinsic value as a worthwhile investment that makes it a payment method worth accepting.Embracing new opportunitiesCastillo cited interest among his company’s customer base – and broader enthusiasm among the precious metals community – as the driving force behind his company's move to go even a step beyond accepting bitcoin and removing credit cards.After seeing so much success with bitcoin, Castillo said Agora Commodities now has a digital currency exchange currently in development.While work still continues on the project, Castillo said that the company is collaborating with an existing exchange to build back-end support, with a portal expected to be integrated with Agora’s online store.He explained:“Bitcoin fits perfectly with gold and silver, right? So if people come to the site and want to buy gold and silver, why wouldn’t they want to buy bitcoin from us as well?”This would build on an existing service that Agora is affiliated with, Castillo said. By working with a third party, Agora will soon allow its customers to exchange precious metals for bitcoin.Castillo added that bitcoin fits well into the broader perspective held by precious metals investors, and he foresees broader involvement from gold investors as the digital currency continues to grow in prominence.Images via Agora CommoditiesThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

These two popular investors disagree on gold and many aspects of the economy, but the one thing they do agree on is the statement that bitcoins have no real value. The crux of their respective arguments comes down to the idea that using Bitcoin as a payment network does not necessarily increase the value of a bitcoin. Money goes into the Bitcoin network and then leaves it on the other side, so these bitcoins should be viewed as nothing more than checks or money orders.[divider]CCN[/divider]The Importance of the 21 Million Bitcoin CapWhile they may not agree that bitcoins can be money, both Buffet and Schiff understand the value of Bitcoin as a protocol and payment system. Peter Schiff even has Bitcoin as a payment option on his precious metals company’s website. There are plenty of situations where Bitcoin is going to be the only viable option for someone who wants to send a digital payment. Here are just a few examples of where Bitcoin is either the best or only option for a digital transfer of money:Censorship-resistant digital payments (Silk Road, Wikileaks, online gambling, etc.)Digital payments where the customer’s personal information is not handed over to a merchant or 3rd partyCheapest, fastest form of international remittancesMerchants offering Bitcoin-only discounts due to the low cost of processing paymentsGetting money out of a country with harsh economic restrictions (Argentina, Venezuela, etc.)As Warren Buffet mentioned in his remarks on CNBC, he does not believe these sorts of use cases add any value to bitcoins. The error in his ways was pointed out by Bill Miller on CNBC not long after Buffet’s original comments. When combining the payments innovation with the fact that there are only 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist, you limit access to the network. To use Warren Buffet’s analogy against his own argument, checks and money orders would be rather valuable if there were only 21 million of them that would ever exist. As users enter the Bitcoin payment system, they are increasing the value of all bitcoins in existence. In other words, the Bitcoin market cap has to be large enough to handle all of the transactions that are going through it at any point in time. Bitcoins would have value even in a scenario where no one saw them as money due to the fact that they need to be purchased in order to use the Bitcoin payment network.Can’t Take the Bitcoins Out of the BitcoinAnother key point missed by both Schiff and Buffet is that you cannot have the benefits of Bitcoin payments without the bitcoin currency. Schiff has often claimed that a combination of Bitcoin and gold would be interesting, but the problem there is you open yourself up to counterparty risk. As we’ve seen in the past with e-gold and similar projects, operating any kind of digital currency where you store a physical commodity in a vault somewhere is not something governments want to allow. One of the main points of Bitcoin is that it allows you to be your own bank, and you can’t really do that if the gold, dollars, or other assets are stored on the other side of the globe. It’s important to remember that all traditional forms of virtual money are really nothing more than IOUs.When you hold bitcoins, you’re holding the actual asset on your computer. Any form of money that stores a large amount of gold or fiat currency in a vault somewhere basically has a huge target on its back once people start using that money for the censorship-resistant payments mentioned above. The fact that a vault filled with gold, silver, euros, or anything else would be seized proves that the real value is in the protocol. Any of these “real world” forms of money would only work in a world where financial censorship did not exist. This is why Bitcoin was created in the first place.Bitcoins are a CommodityIf you’re not sold on the payments argument, then there’s still another aspect of bitcoin where you can find value. At the end of the day, Bitcoin is a distributed ledger with no centralized entity controlling the accounts. The bitcoins on the ledger are nothing more than a unit of account, which means that can be “colored” to represent anything from a house to a US dollar. This ledger is the perfect tool for proving ownership, or even existence, and you have to purchase some bitcoins if you plan to enter some information into the ledger. The limited number of bitcoins on the ledger means there is only so much space or real estate for sale. This fact alone gives a bitcoin value as a commodity, even if no one wants to believe that it can also be money.What About Inflation Through Altcoins?One last point that needs to be made when it comes to dismissing the arguments against bitcoin’s fundamental value made by Buffet, Schiff, and others is that altcoins do not equal inflation for the digital currency. For this part of the debate, it’s important to remember the power of the network effect. It’s extremely difficult for any other altcoin to gain a large amount of support due to the extra security and stability that is brought to Bitcoin through network effects. The large amount of hashing power behind Bitcoin mining makes it the most secure ledger powered by proof-of-work on the market, and the amount of liquidity already in the bitcoin market helps bring stability to the price of the digital currency. In other words, people are going to use bitcoins as a commodity on the Bitcoin blockchain because it is the most secure ledger, and individuals are also going to use Bitcoin for payments due to the lower amount of volatility found in the bitcoin currency.Unless another cryptocurrency is able to attack these two key advantages of Bitcoin, then there is nothing to worry about when it comes to altcoins. It’s also important to remember that Bitcoin can always adopt the features of an altcoin if it is actually a threat to the existing protocol. In a worst case scenario where the Bitcoin protocol is not updated with the features of a new altcoin that would make it more secure and less volatile, everyone can simply move over to that new chain. Having said all that, altcoins still hold a purpose in the cryptocurrency community. They are the perfect test environment for new features that could be added to Bitcoin in the future, and they also offer a casino to gamblers who want to bet on how high an altcoin can go before it crashes back down to reality.Photo via brewbooks.Advertisement:', 'Rockminer has been growing fast in the Bitcoin ASIC miner industry and they have recently taken another step forward with their Rockminer T1 miner. This miner starts things off with a new design that steps away from the tube design that many of the Bitcoin ASIC mining manufacturers are starting to use. The new design allows for stacking and ease of use in that you can easily access cables and connections while maintaining a hot and cold isle in large installations, as well as general simple ease of use in smaller installations. The T1 also has a new controller, instead of a Raspberry Pi, it comes with a BE200 Jet Stratum Miner V 5.47 controller. This new controller can run 3 T1 miners. The specs of the T1 are good as well with Rockminer upping the speed again over the R3-Box.Specifications: Rockminer T1HashRate: 780~840GH/S ;Power Consumption: 1000W;Cooling: Air cooling system;General Size: 250mm x 250mm x 200mmBlade: 4 Blabes 250mm x 150mmWeight: 8.8 lbs PSU: 4 x 6PIN PCI-E 8 PCIe power connections are available Controller:BE200 Jet Stratum Miner V 5.47 Cube design and stack-able[divider]CCN[/divider]The Rockminer T1 arrived at my door with no bumps or bangs. The shipping gods are paying me back for the BTC Garden that had arrived busted up not too long ago. The T1 is packaged very safely with foam and also included the BE200 Jet Stratum Miner V 5.47 controller and power cord packed safely within as well. The T1’s packaging will make it look larger than it is. The cube shape is compact and well protected by the chassis. You will quickly find that there are 8 PCIe connections on the unit, 2 per blade. Only one needs to be connected per blade for normal operation. If you are going to OC, make sure that you have a beefy power supply and all 8 power connections attached. I used an EVGA 1300 watt Supernova Gold for this review. The BE200 connects to the miner via a three pin connector cable to the blades that are wired in series. The BE200 can control up to 3 th/s total or 4 x T1s. As of the time of writing this the cable are only long enough to chain 3 together. There will be longer cables in the near future. To connect two or more units, you would connect the cable from the bottom in the chain of one unit to the top of the chain on the 2nd unit. There are a set of instructions on Rockminer’s blog to allow for the extra miners. At the time of this writing, I only have the one T1 unit to test with. If I am able to get a 2nd, I will update with a full walk through of the multi-link process. A few key things with the BE200 on setup, the controller uses the default 192.168.0.254 address, and you need to log in using 192.168.0.254:8000 to access it. If your network is setup on 192.168.1.1 as many are, then you will either need to switch it to 192.168.0.1 and change the controller to it and flip back or connect directly to a laptop that you configure to communicate with it. Once you have it on your network, you can then start with the settings. The settings screen is simple and yet has easy overclocking features and a solid, detailed statistics page. The test status page shows you the chips and if they are up or down. This feature can be handy for troubleshooting board issues.The BE200 controller is very picky about pool setups. On mine, I set it up using a tablet. The tablet was adding a “space” at the end of my pool selection that did not cause an issue on other controllers yet stopped this one dead. Dogie also told me that they have a large block limitation that can cause issues with some pools. I was able to get it to work on BTCGuild and yet had troubles with Eligius. Nasty Pool worked fine, that one is a P2Pool, but the hash rate was cut down to 620 gh/s. For this review, I used BTC Guild. I want to note here that Rockminer’s customer service is amazing. When I had an issue at first with getting the controller to connect to pools, Alex of Rockminer got right on Skype with me and gave me some extra settings to try. I am impressed by that. Rockminer also has a nice detailed setup guide to for troubleshooting as well. Rockminer has impressed me each time with their miners, service and prices. They are determined to grow and bring mining to more people, and it shows with the little touches like that. [divider]CCN[/divider] When running, the T1 is quiet compared to many of the other miners I have reviewed lately. At 4 feet, I read 53 dB from it on normal settings and when clocked to chip Freq 300 it was 59 dB at the same distance. This lower noise makes it a nice unit for in-home mining as long as you have it in another room.The miner itself has the fans pull the air in over the blades that gives it a nice even cooling rate. The miner stayed cool even in my hot mining room. My best results were on BTCGuild with an average hash rate of 750 gh/s to 793 gh/s over 24 hrs at Freq of 270. The Rockminer T1 is a solid next step for Rockminer. The easy to stack cases with the ability to chain up to three together. The side access for power connections makes it easy to connect your PSU to the unit and standard access point when stacking. With it’s small size, you can fit a lot of them in a small amount of space. The controller being a bit sensitive can make it difficult for new miners but their excellent customer support will help get those who do have trouble up and running quickly. More experienced miners will like the tweaking features and performance. With the Rockminer T1 and BE200 controllers, the usual 10% rejection rate that seems to plague the AM Gen 3 chip has come down to 6% to 7% in my tests. When I first started running the T1, it was hovering at 4% but it did tick up over 24 hrs. Still an improvement which shows me that Rockminer is looking to make improvements for performance that work and that they are getting some positive results doing so. The Rockminer T1 is a solid entrant into the market and a good choice. Rockminer as a company continues to improve and push out easy to use well-performing miners.

The company was founded in May 2012 by banker and entrepreneur Denis Kiselev, and co-founder and CTO Natalia Pavlova.Knox Payments is a service that allows merchants to accept payments from their customer\'s bank accounts through ACH (Automated Clearing House) payments. ACH is an electronic network for financial transactions in the US, processing large volumes of credit and debit transactions in batches.Knox Payments was launched in February 2014, after raising US$900,000 from undisclosed Virginia-based angel investors. In an interview with Venture Beat, Knox Payments\' co-founder Tommy Nicholas stated:""Now a business can put our button on their website, and when people go to pay, they can choose to pay with their bank. Our thesis is around making this process way faster and reducing keystrokes. You can go through an online checkout in three clicks. We only charge $0.18 per transactions over $2.""Through this partnership, US Ripples users are now able to make deposits to their Ripple accounts from banks Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Capital One, Capital One 360, USAA, TD Bank, US Bank, PNC or Chase, with a daily limit of US$300.SnapSwap introduced the new feature called Instant Deposit on August 21, according to a blog announcement. It added that SnapSwap was ""currently working on adding other major US banks.’Formerly OpenCoin, Ripple Labs developed the Ripple protocol, an open-source, distributed payment protocol, which enables free and instant payments in any currency, including dollars, yen, euros, bitcoins and loyalty points.According to the release:""One of the primary early challenges faced by Ripple users has been getting value on the network, but as the ecosystem continues to evolve and expand, this process will only become more seamless, and in the case of this latest SnapSwap development, a lot more instant.""There have been many exciting news from Ripple during the last couple months. In late-July, precious metal provider Gold Bullion International announced the opening of a live gateway on the Ripple protocol as well as the creation of new gold-backed cryptocurrency, XAU.Earlier this month, Shift Payments announced its all-in-one debit card, a product born from a partnership between Shift and SnapSwap\'s product SmartyCash. Shift\'s debit card is an innovative payment card that is integrated with both Coinbase and Ripple, and that enables payments in ripples, bitcoins, traditional money and loyalty points.Ripple beyond the WestBut the Ripple effect has spread out much further than just America and Europe. On August 25, CoinTelegraph reached out to Bali-based entrepreneur Stephen DeMeulenaere, on a project he\'s been working on with Singapore-based entrepreneur Ric Shreves, The two entrepreneurs are determined to bring Ripple to Southeast Asia through the implementation of a Ripple gateway in Indonesia.In an email interview, DeMeulenaere explained the opportunities for Ripple regarding the Indonesian remittance market, which receives approximately US$7.5bn each year, as well as the regional money transfer market within the ASEAN zone. He added:""Transfers from America and Europe make up the majority of remittance transfers to Indonesia, so this new agreement for Ripple is great news for creating new possibilities for opening up the remittance market.""The entrepreneur added that they\'ve been in talk with the team at Ripple Labs, stating that ""they\'ve been very professional and supportive, and very well aware of the significant opportunities a gateway for Indonesia would bring to the network"".Ripple Indonesia hasn\'t set an official launch date as they are still in the process of acquiring the necessary permits, but they hope it will be by early 2015.Did you enjoy this article?

For Castillo, the purchase of gold with credit doesn’t make sense.By comparison, he sees digital currency’s underlying technical characteristics and the intrinsic value as a worthwhile investment that makes it a payment method worth accepting.Embracing new opportunitiesCastillo cited interest among his company’s customer base – and broader enthusiasm among the precious metals community – as the driving force behind his company's move to go even a step beyond accepting bitcoin and removing credit cards.After seeing so much success with bitcoin, Castillo said Agora Commodities now has a digital currency exchange currently in development.While work still continues on the project, Castillo said that the company is collaborating with an existing exchange to build back-end support, with a portal expected to be integrated with Agora’s online store.He explained:“Bitcoin fits perfectly with gold and silver, right? So if people come to the site and want to buy gold and silver, why wouldn’t they want to buy bitcoin from us as well?”This would build on an existing service that Agora is affiliated with, Castillo said. By working with a third party, Agora will soon allow its customers to exchange precious metals for bitcoin.Castillo added that bitcoin fits well into the broader perspective held by precious metals investors, and he foresees broader involvement from gold investors as the digital currency continues to grow in prominence.Images via Agora CommoditiesThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

These two popular investors disagree on gold and many aspects of the economy, but the one thing they do agree on is the statement that bitcoins have no real value. The crux of their respective arguments comes down to the idea that using Bitcoin as a payment network does not necessarily increase the value of a bitcoin. Money goes into the Bitcoin network and then leaves it on the other side, so these bitcoins should be viewed as nothing more than checks or money orders.[divider]CCN[/divider]The Importance of the 21 Million Bitcoin CapWhile they may not agree that bitcoins can be money, both Buffet and Schiff understand the value of Bitcoin as a protocol and payment system. Peter Schiff even has Bitcoin as a payment option on his precious metals company’s website. There are plenty of situations where Bitcoin is going to be the only viable option for someone who wants to send a digital payment. Here are just a few examples of where Bitcoin is either the best or only option for a digital transfer of money:Censorship-resistant digital payments (Silk Road, Wikileaks, online gambling, etc.)Digital payments where the customer’s personal information is not handed over to a merchant or 3rd partyCheapest, fastest form of international remittancesMerchants offering Bitcoin-only discounts due to the low cost of processing paymentsGetting money out of a country with harsh economic restrictions (Argentina, Venezuela, etc.)As Warren Buffet mentioned in his remarks on CNBC, he does not believe these sorts of use cases add any value to bitcoins. The error in his ways was pointed out by Bill Miller on CNBC not long after Buffet’s original comments. When combining the payments innovation with the fact that there are only 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist, you limit access to the network. To use Warren Buffet’s analogy against his own argument, checks and money orders would be rather valuable if there were only 21 million of them that would ever exist. As users enter the Bitcoin payment system, they are increasing the value of all bitcoins in existence. In other words, the Bitcoin market cap has to be large enough to handle all of the transactions that are going through it at any point in time. Bitcoins would have value even in a scenario where no one saw them as money due to the fact that they need to be purchased in order to use the Bitcoin payment network.Can’t Take the Bitcoins Out of the BitcoinAnother key point missed by both Schiff and Buffet is that you cannot have the benefits of Bitcoin payments without the bitcoin currency. Schiff has often claimed that a combination of Bitcoin and gold would be interesting, but the problem there is you open yourself up to counterparty risk. As we’ve seen in the past with e-gold and similar projects, operating any kind of digital currency where you store a physical commodity in a vault somewhere is not something governments want to allow. One of the main points of Bitcoin is that it allows you to be your own bank, and you can’t really do that if the gold, dollars, or other assets are stored on the other side of the globe. It’s important to remember that all traditional forms of virtual money are really nothing more than IOUs.When you hold bitcoins, you’re holding the actual asset on your computer. Any form of money that stores a large amount of gold or fiat currency in a vault somewhere basically has a huge target on its back once people start using that money for the censorship-resistant payments mentioned above. The fact that a vault filled with gold, silver, euros, or anything else would be seized proves that the real value is in the protocol. Any of these “real world” forms of money would only work in a world where financial censorship did not exist. This is why Bitcoin was created in the first place.Bitcoins are a CommodityIf you’re not sold on the payments argument, then there’s still another aspect of bitcoin where you can find value. At the end of the day, Bitcoin is a distributed ledger with no centralized entity controlling the accounts. The bitcoins on the ledger are nothing more than a unit of account, which means that can be “colored” to represent anything from a house to a US dollar. This ledger is the perfect tool for proving ownership, or even existence, and you have to purchase some bitcoins if you plan to enter some information into the ledger. The limited number of bitcoins on the ledger means there is only so much space or real estate for sale. This fact alone gives a bitcoin value as a commodity, even if no one wants to believe that it can also be money.What About Inflation Through Altcoins?One last point that needs to be made when it comes to dismissing the arguments against bitcoin’s fundamental value made by Buffet, Schiff, and others is that altcoins do not equal inflation for the digital currency. For this part of the debate, it’s important to remember the power of the network effect. It’s extremely difficult for any other altcoin to gain a large amount of support due to the extra security and stability that is brought to Bitcoin through network effects. The large amount of hashing power behind Bitcoin mining makes it the most secure ledger powered by proof-of-work on the market, and the amount of liquidity already in the bitcoin market helps bring stability to the price of the digital currency. In other words, people are going to use bitcoins as a commodity on the Bitcoin blockchain because it is the most secure ledger, and individuals are also going to use Bitcoin for payments due to the lower amount of volatility found in the bitcoin currency.Unless another cryptocurrency is able to attack these two key advantages of Bitcoin, then there is nothing to worry about when it comes to altcoins. It’s also important to remember that Bitcoin can always adopt the features of an altcoin if it is actually a threat to the existing protocol. In a worst case scenario where the Bitcoin protocol is not updated with the features of a new altcoin that would make it more secure and less volatile, everyone can simply move over to that new chain. Having said all that, altcoins still hold a purpose in the cryptocurrency community. They are the perfect test environment for new features that could be added to Bitcoin in the future, and they also offer a casino to gamblers who want to bet on how high an altcoin can go before it crashes back down to reality.Photo via brewbooks.Advertisement:', 'Rockminer has been growing fast in the Bitcoin ASIC miner industry and they have recently taken another step forward with their Rockminer T1 miner. This miner starts things off with a new design that steps away from the tube design that many of the Bitcoin ASIC mining manufacturers are starting to use. The new design allows for stacking and ease of use in that you can easily access cables and connections while maintaining a hot and cold isle in large installations, as well as general simple ease of use in smaller installations. The T1 also has a new controller, instead of a Raspberry Pi, it comes with a BE200 Jet Stratum Miner V 5.47 controller. This new controller can run 3 T1 miners. The specs of the T1 are good as well with Rockminer upping the speed again over the R3-Box.Specifications: Rockminer T1HashRate: 780~840GH/S ;Power Consumption: 1000W;Cooling: Air cooling system;General Size: 250mm x 250mm x 200mmBlade: 4 Blabes 250mm x 150mmWeight: 8.8 lbs PSU: 4 x 6PIN PCI-E 8 PCIe power connections are available Controller:BE200 Jet Stratum Miner V 5.47 Cube design and stack-able[divider]CCN[/divider]The Rockminer T1 arrived at my door with no bumps or bangs. The shipping gods are paying me back for the BTC Garden that had arrived busted up not too long ago. The T1 is packaged very safely with foam and also included the BE200 Jet Stratum Miner V 5.47 controller and power cord packed safely within as well. The T1’s packaging will make it look larger than it is. The cube shape is compact and well protected by the chassis. You will quickly find that there are 8 PCIe connections on the unit, 2 per blade. Only one needs to be connected per blade for normal operation. If you are going to OC, make sure that you have a beefy power supply and all 8 power connections attached. I used an EVGA 1300 watt Supernova Gold for this review. The BE200 connects to the miner via a three pin connector cable to the blades that are wired in series. The BE200 can control up to 3 th/s total or 4 x T1s. As of the time of writing this the cable are only long enough to chain 3 together. There will be longer cables in the near future. To connect two or more units, you would connect the cable from the bottom in the chain of one unit to the top of the chain on the 2nd unit. There are a set of instructions on Rockminer’s blog to allow for the extra miners. At the time of this writing, I only have the one T1 unit to test with. If I am able to get a 2nd, I will update with a full walk through of the multi-link process. A few key things with the BE200 on setup, the controller uses the default 192.168.0.254 address, and you need to log in using 192.168.0.254:8000 to access it. If your network is setup on 192.168.1.1 as many are, then you will either need to switch it to 192.168.0.1 and change the controller to it and flip back or connect directly to a laptop that you configure to communicate with it. Once you have it on your network, you can then start with the settings. The settings screen is simple and yet has easy overclocking features and a solid, detailed statistics page. The test status page shows you the chips and if they are up or down. This feature can be handy for troubleshooting board issues.The BE200 controller is very picky about pool setups. On mine, I set it up using a tablet. The tablet was adding a “space” at the end of my pool selection that did not cause an issue on other controllers yet stopped this one dead. Dogie also told me that they have a large block limitation that can cause issues with some pools. I was able to get it to work on BTCGuild and yet had troubles with Eligius. Nasty Pool worked fine, that one is a P2Pool, but the hash rate was cut down to 620 gh/s. For this review, I used BTC Guild. I want to note here that Rockminer’s customer service is amazing. When I had an issue at first with getting the controller to connect to pools, Alex of Rockminer got right on Skype with me and gave me some extra settings to try. I am impressed by that. Rockminer also has a nice detailed setup guide to for troubleshooting as well. Rockminer has impressed me each time with their miners, service and prices. They are determined to grow and bring mining to more people, and it shows with the little touches like that. [divider]CCN[/divider] When running, the T1 is quiet compared to many of the other miners I have reviewed lately. At 4 feet, I read 53 dB from it on normal settings and when clocked to chip Freq 300 it was 59 dB at the same distance. This lower noise makes it a nice unit for in-home mining as long as you have it in another room.The miner itself has the fans pull the air in over the blades that gives it a nice even cooling rate. The miner stayed cool even in my hot mining room. My best results were on BTCGuild with an average hash rate of 750 gh/s to 793 gh/s over 24 hrs at Freq of 270. The Rockminer T1 is a solid next step for Rockminer. The easy to stack cases with the ability to chain up to three together. The side access for power connections makes it easy to connect your PSU to the unit and standard access point when stacking. With it’s small size, you can fit a lot of them in a small amount of space. The controller being a bit sensitive can make it difficult for new miners but their excellent customer support will help get those who do have trouble up and running quickly. More experienced miners will like the tweaking features and performance. With the Rockminer T1 and BE200 controllers, the usual 10% rejection rate that seems to plague the AM Gen 3 chip has come down to 6% to 7% in my tests. When I first started running the T1, it was hovering at 4% but it did tick up over 24 hrs. Still an improvement which shows me that Rockminer is looking to make improvements for performance that work and that they are getting some positive results doing so. The Rockminer T1 is a solid entrant into the market and a good choice. Rockminer as a company continues to improve and push out easy to use well-performing miners.

The company was founded in May 2012 by banker and entrepreneur Denis Kiselev, and co-founder and CTO Natalia Pavlova.Knox Payments is a service that allows merchants to accept payments from their customer\'s bank accounts through ACH (Automated Clearing House) payments. ACH is an electronic network for financial transactions in the US, processing large volumes of credit and debit transactions in batches.Knox Payments was launched in February 2014, after raising US$900,000 from undisclosed Virginia-based angel investors. In an interview with Venture Beat, Knox Payments\' co-founder Tommy Nicholas stated:""Now a business can put our button on their website, and when people go to pay, they can choose to pay with their bank. Our thesis is around making this process way faster and reducing keystrokes. You can go through an online checkout in three clicks. We only charge $0.18 per transactions over $2.""Through this partnership, US Ripples users are now able to make deposits to their Ripple accounts from banks Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Capital One, Capital One 360, USAA, TD Bank, US Bank, PNC or Chase, with a daily limit of US$300.SnapSwap introduced the new feature called Instant Deposit on August 21, according to a blog announcement. It added that SnapSwap was ""currently working on adding other major US banks.’Formerly OpenCoin, Ripple Labs developed the Ripple protocol, an open-source, distributed payment protocol, which enables free and instant payments in any currency, including dollars, yen, euros, bitcoins and loyalty points.According to the release:""One of the primary early challenges faced by Ripple users has been getting value on the network, but as the ecosystem continues to evolve and expand, this process will only become more seamless, and in the case of this latest SnapSwap development, a lot more instant.""There have been many exciting news from Ripple during the last couple months. In late-July, precious metal provider Gold Bullion International announced the opening of a live gateway on the Ripple protocol as well as the creation of new gold-backed cryptocurrency, XAU.Earlier this month, Shift Payments announced its all-in-one debit card, a product born from a partnership between Shift and SnapSwap\'s product SmartyCash. Shift\'s debit card is an innovative payment card that is integrated with both Coinbase and Ripple, and that enables payments in ripples, bitcoins, traditional money and loyalty points.Ripple beyond the WestBut the Ripple effect has spread out much further than just America and Europe. On August 25, CoinTelegraph reached out to Bali-based entrepreneur Stephen DeMeulenaere, on a project he\'s been working on with Singapore-based entrepreneur Ric Shreves, The two entrepreneurs are determined to bring Ripple to Southeast Asia through the implementation of a Ripple gateway in Indonesia.In an email interview, DeMeulenaere explained the opportunities for Ripple regarding the Indonesian remittance market, which receives approximately US$7.5bn each year, as well as the regional money transfer market within the ASEAN zone. He added:""Transfers from America and Europe make up the majority of remittance transfers to Indonesia, so this new agreement for Ripple is great news for creating new possibilities for opening up the remittance market.""The entrepreneur added that they\'ve been in talk with the team at Ripple Labs, stating that ""they\'ve been very professional and supportive, and very well aware of the significant opportunities a gateway for Indonesia would bring to the network"".Ripple Indonesia hasn\'t set an official launch date as they are still in the process of acquiring the necessary permits, but they hope it will be by early 2015.Did you enjoy this article?

09/07/2014,"['British bitcoin voucher service Azteco and South African startup Xoin have separately launched services designed for one potentially huge emerging market; namely, the unbanked populations of Africa.Azteco, which claims it is ""the easiest way to buy bitcoins"", has announced that it is in the final stage of development of its voucher product and is already accepting applications from prospective vendors.Xoin is also introducing prepaid bitcoin vouchers that allow customers to buy bitcoins with cash.Both services are designed to appeal to unbanked and underbanked markets, with an emphasis on e-commerce and remittances in Africa.""Buying bitcoin is unnecessarily hard,"" saif Azteco founder Akin Fernandez. ""We solve this problem with a simple, fast and elegant solution, that\'s easy for users and easy for vendors.”World changerAzteco\'s vouchers are bought over the counter for cash and can be redeemed with any bitcoin address. Additionally, they are simple for vendors to dispense, requiring just a computer, web access and a printer, removing the need for any specialised equipment.""Bitcoin is set to change the way people send money globally,"" Fernandez continued, ""and this will be especially powerful and transforming for the third-world diaspora, eliminating the financial network access problems that plague the unbanked, helping them to break out of the poverty cycle.""Fernandez argued that what he calls the “bitcoin wave” started with retailer adoption, and saw many bitcoin users chasing a handful of retailers willing to accept the cryptocurrency. While adoption is increasing, Fernandez said he still sees a problem with bringing bitcoin to the masses, explaining:""Currently, getting bitcoin is still hard. Azteco makes it very easy, and it is also very fast. There are no unnecessary interrupting steps in Azteco. Using bitcoin is no more difficult than sending a text message from your mobile phone. Everyone would laugh at the idea of a centralized text messaging service where you have to manually log in to send a text; Azteco goes one step further, removing the need for a mobile phone altogether.""\'Password fatigue\'Fernandez pointed out that many of the world’s 2.2 billion unbanked people do not have a smartphone, yet they need a way to access the latest payments technologies and employ them in e-commerce markets.People are impatient, he added. Azteco noticed that people were not concerned about not having to sign up and even liked that they don\'t have to, according to the founder.""There is a lot of username and password fatigue out there, and we tap into this animus by not requiring it,"" he said.He added:""Fees are 4%, and we are very fast – 60 seconds on average – and we\'re getting faster. There is no sign up, no waiting period, and no customer verification. You pay for your voucher and get your bitcoin immediately, just like topping up a \'pay as you go\' mobile phone.""The company, which opened London’s first bitcoin voucher shop last February, said potential vendors can rest assured that they are not exposed to any risk.""Our vendors are protected by a three-way agreement where top London law firm Keystone Law holds the vendor bonds securely. These bonds are 100% returnable to the vendor. Rather than spend thousands on an ATM, our vendors can use that money immediately to start selling bitcoin across all their sites, simultaneously, risk free,"" Fernandez said.African remittancesXoin is taking a similar approach, making bitcoin available through prepaid vouchers and gift cards, but specifically targetting young South Africans.“The unbanked markets, especially teenagers with mobile phones in Africa, are entirely excluded from e-commerce,"" Xoin co-founder Helghardt Avenant told Venture Burn. ""Bitcoin makes e-commerce more accessible to these markets, especially when it comes to virtual goods.”Xoin said that its service was designed for new bitcoin users. The service includes a pre-loaded wallet with the face value of each voucher.The vouchers can be purchased from merchants using cash. Customers then scan the code using a smartphone and redeem their bitcoins. The service uses the South African BitX exchange and its real-time exchange rate. For the time being, it is web-based only.Xoin said that its service enables all vendors to become bitcoin ATMs at a much lower cost than currently available ATMs. The team demonstrated the functionality by setting up a doughnut shop in the street.Avenant told CoinDesk that the Xoin team is trying to solve a glaring problem for bitcoin: limited accessibility for the unbanked population.He also said the company is not charging any fees for the time being and meets regularly with its merchants for feedback, adding:""The local merchants on Stellenbosch campus have agreed to take part in the experimental phase and are currently selling Xoin prepaid bitcoin without earning commission. In the future we will charge a fee of 7%. The reseller earns 4% commission. The exchange takes 1% and Xoin takes 1%. The remaining 1% goes to the actual printing cost.""The self-funded company was launched by Stellenbosch University postgraduates, and hopes to use the campus to exercise its word-of-mouth marketing.“Students come from all over the country,"" said Avenant. ""We hope that they do the work to spread the word of Xoin when they return to their homes.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Many residents in his community were stuck powerless until the local utility company restored the grid, while some subsisted on solar energy. It was after that, Levy said, that he sought a solution and came upon GoTenna.The gadget -- a small Bluetooth-enabled rod packed to the brim with modern radio innards -- lets you create your own private, secure communication network for sending messages without cell service using your smartphone. Though marketed toward outdoors and emergency situations like hiking and disaster relief, GoTenna is getting a boost from the cryptography community. Levy, whose neighborhood gets little to zero reliable cell service, happens to represent both. He\'s among the more than 25 percent of GoTenna preorder customers who paid for the product with the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.""We do not need to be dependent on centralized industries for our communication, which is a very important part of our modern lives,"" Levy told CNET. The developer runs WebOfTrust.net, a peer-to-peer credit and collaboration-focused social network currently in development that aims to take the decentralization and financial empowerment elements of Bitcoin and apply them to his local community in Hawaii. He\'s considering integrating with GoTenna using the company\'s software development kit (API) to link the gadget with his Web platform.""With GoTenna, we can create our own, decentralized mesh network that we own, and be in control of the data that we create,"" he said. Levy said he wouldn\'t have purchased GoTenna had the company not accepted Bitcoin as payment, nor if the device\'s communication lines had not been end-to-end encrypted and the messages never stored, he said. ""If it proves to be useful, I would like to encourage my community to start utilizing these devices.""Chatting in dead zones, from Burning Man and beyondGoTenna, which began taking preorders for pairs of its off-the-grid communication device in July to ship this fall, represents a unique blend. Its product mixes everyday consumer needs with the modern, more niche necessities of Web-savvy users who rely on encryption to navigate our increasingly spying- and risk-fraught communications technology.While a novel accessory, GoTenna\'s multipurpose functionality is popping up more and more, especially in software. Mobile apps like FireChat and the Serval Mesh let users create mesh networks -- a way to rig together smartphone communication links via Bluetooth, like daisychaining USB or Ethernet cables -- for communicating without cell service as well, though at far shorter ranges. GoTenna, which does not use mesh networking technology and instead sends messages on a distinct and separate radio wave frequency, works up to 50 miles at high elevations and nine miles in most outdoor scenarios.Screenshot by Nick Statt/CNETFireChat\'s developer, OpenGarden, regularly orchestrates campaigns to get FireChat up and running at events like large-scale music festivals and off-the-grid retreats like Burning Man. Yet all the while FireChat also offers encryption enthusiasts a tool for speaking beyond the eyes of Verizon, Google or the National Security Agency.Point the finger at whistle-blower Edward Snowden\'s bombshell NSA leaks last year or at the seemingly never-ending onslaught of hacks threatening our largest institutions and retail stores. Whichever is sending the loudest message, it\'s now clear that encryption is no longer something reserved for the paranoid or the hacker and security communities.""People have begun contacting us much more about encryption tools, whether it\'s the people who are inventing private-messaging tools and devices or people asking for comment on them from the press,"" said Seth Schoen, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ""We\'ve heard from people who\'ve said that they were inspired by the Snowden revelations to create privacy tools. In that sense there is a definite uptick.""GoTenna\'s dual purposeGoTenna pairs with your smartphone and lets you send text messages and location data through an app to other users of the device, which is why the gadget is sold in pairs. The messages are end-to-end encrypted using public-private key encryption, the company said, the same method that protects e-commerce transactions on the Internet.The catch: GoTenna was designed for everyday consumers, but with some wiggle room. On one hand, it was meant to be a device that wouldn\'t have to rely on gadget-loving early adopters and would instead appeal more to people in situations like Gregg Berkholtz, a datacenter consultant living in Portland, Ore.Though quite tech savvy, Berkholtz -- a regular backpacker who also takes disaster preparedness measures -- can\'t reliably use walkie-talkies. ""Having a profound hearing loss, and with a cochlear implant in my near future, a method for reliable off-grid communications is high on my goals list,"" Berkholtz told CNET. That makes a smartphone text messaging device a no-brainer, regardless of encryption.""Certainly the feedback that we\'re getting now is validating a lot of the assumptions that we were going on before,"" said GoTenna chief Daniela Perdomo. ""It was interesting to see that even communities that aren\'t normally on the bleeding edge of technology buying GoTenna. But if you\'re solving a problem that is real to them, they\'re going to come out of the woodwork, whether it\'s a cabin in Montana or the wilderness of Alaska.""However, Perdomo, with the expertise of her brother and co-founder Jorge -- a systems architect and GoTenna\'s CTO -- figured that if they accepted Bitcoins and advertised the device\'s encryption perk, it might appeal to certain subsets of the crypto community. That would allow GoTenna to appeal to people like Levy who may or may not have a need for off-the-grid communication but are nonetheless interested in taking handheld encryption on the go.""If you\'re solving a problem that is real to them, they\'re going to come out of the woodwork."" Daniela Perdomo, GoTenna CEO""I definitely don\'t think there\'s one way to use it,"" Perdomo said. Though that makes GoTenna hard to market sometimes, she admits, it means that instead of being restricted to a few use cases, the device could be co-opted by all kinds of enthusiasts and used however they see fit.""Bitcoiners quickly understand GoTenna\'s technology and appreciate our commitment to privacy and decentralization,"" Perdomo told CoinDesk in July.The strength of the cryptography helps too. GoTenna uses 224-bit elliptic curve encryption, an advanced cryptographic algorithm that, depending on how it\'s used, can be safer than other, more standard methods like RSA. The company strengthened GoTenna\'s protection by using two-factor identification, meaning only those who can access the device associated with their phone number can begin receiving and sending messages using GoTenna. Furthermore, the app gives users the control, using public keys to encrypt messages but private ones to decipher them once they\'re received.""This method allows each individual GoTenna user to have their own unique set of key ciphers,"" Jorge Perdomo explained in an email exchange with CNET. That\'s important because it means that hacking one GoTenna doesn\'t create vulnerabilities in every device. ""In a way, even our encryption could be said to be decentralized,"" he added.Update at 6:40 p.m. PT: Clarified that GoTenna does not rely on mesh networking to send messages from one device to another.Update at 11:20 a.m. PT, Monday, Sept. 8: A previous version of this article said that GoTenna\'s platform contained a public API; the company has a SDK, not an API. A quote was incorrectly attributed to Jorge Perdomo when it should have been attributed to Daniela Perdomo.', 'Jeevan Vasagar in Essen SEPTEMBER 7, 2014 7 Power prices paid by Germany’s Mittelstand companies have reached twice the level facing some of their US rivals, a study has shown, underlining the threat posed to the country’s competitiveness by its shift to renewable energy. A typical medium-sized German industrial company pays 9.14 euro cents per kilowatt hour compared with 4.82 cents/kWh in Texas, according to research carried out by Ecofys, a consultancy, and the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research. The study, commissioned by the German government, is based on prices paid over the past two years. Europe\'s biggest economy is switching its electricity supply from conventional sources to clean energy, a shift that began in 2000 but acquired fresh urgency after the Fukushima disaster, when chancellor Angela Merkel accelerated the phase-out of nuclear energy. ""No comparable country is undertaking such a radical change in its energy supply,"" Ms Merkel said earlier this year. ""But I am convinced that if any country can succeed with this energy transition it is Germany."" The success of the transition, known as the Energiewende, has become a fiercely contentious issue, with companies threatening to move investment abroad to avoid the costly surcharges on their bills used to fund the shift. Heribert Hauck, general manager for energy at Trimet Aluminum, one of Germany’s biggest electricity consumers, said: “For us, and for the whole economy, the Energiewende is an enormous challenge, a gigantic experiment that is not yet at an end.” Trimet, a family-owned business which is Germany’s biggest producer of aluminium, consumes 6.3 terawatt-hours of energy a year – around 1 per cent of Germany’s net electricity consumption – at a cost of over €300m. The renewables surcharge is currently €62.40 per megawatt-hour, but to protect jobs the German government grants generous discounts to its most energy-hungry businesses. Energy-intensive companies with an international client base pay 15 per cent of the levy. For the biggest users, such as steel mills, contributions are capped at 0.5 per cent of gross added value. Around 2,000 companies, including Trimet, currently benefit from waivers on the surcharge, an exemption that is worth a total of €5.1bn this year. The discounts mean that industry will pay around €7.4bn in surcharges this year, while households will disburse just over €8bn. Leaders of German industry remain critical of the renewable energy surcharge and are envious of counterparts in the US, who have benefited from the shale gas boom. But supporters of the transition argue that the gap in competitiveness with the US is narrowing because the expansion of subsidised renewables has pushed Germany\'s wholesale energy prices down. Teutonic shifts For a closer look at the problems facing German companies and the wide-ranging consequences Visit our in-depth page Analysis by Agora Energiewende, a Berlin-based think-tank set up to support the shift to renewable energy, finds that the spot price in Germany fell below the prices in three US regions in the first half of this year. The average German day-ahead price in the first half of 2014 was €32.37/MWh, compared with €63.38/MWh in the PJM West market, which covers an area from the east coast to Ohio. Day ahead prices for the Midwest and California were €43.42/MWh and €41.50/MWh respectively.  Power prices in the US have been pushed up this year by exceptionally cold winter weather, but data gathered by Agora Energiewende last year indicates that wholesale electricity prices for Germany and the US were already converging. Patrick Graichen, executive director of Agora Energiewende, said: “Electricity prices are not an argument for switching production from here to the US. What is true is that gas prices in the US are significantly lower.” “When it comes to electricity usage I would say that there is no longer a big gap in competitiveness.” Industrialists insist, however, that the switch to renewable energy has not only raised end-prices for users, but made supply more volatile. Trimet has signed an agreement with the grid operator to be paid a standby fee in exchange for accepting interruptions to its supply. So far this year, the company has taken production offline twice. Mr Hauck said: “When the input of renewable energy is less than expected – a fairly typical situation – and baseload energy is insufficient, we can be switched off.” The company is pushing for greater clarity from Berlin about the future levels of compensation for operating flexibly. That will become clearer in autumn, when Sigmar Gabriel, economy minister, is due to publish proposals for power market design.

The new incentives replace a hotchpotch of perks with a uniform programme that sweetens traders’ rebates as their volumes surpass certain thresholds. Only the biggest high-frequency trading firms are likely to qualify for the most generous rebates, people familiar with the matter said. CME’s new incentives, which took effect last week [September 1], apply to energy futures created as many as three decades ago: crude oil, natural gas, diesel and gasoline. Energy has the second largest share of the exchange’s $2.5bn clearing and transaction fee revenue, comprising 23 per cent of the total last year. According to people who have seen the rebate programme details, proprietary trading groups would fall into one of eight tiers based on their average daily volumes in the energy products. Transactions of at least 150,000 contracts per day would place a trader in the top tier, eligible for $0.45 rebates from the standard $0.55-per-contract member trading fee. Top rebates could exceed $16m annually, assuming a normal trading calendar. The changes come nine months after CME raised trading fees. Volumes in the four energy contracts have declined in the year to August. Some traders praised the programme’s consistent criteria for rebates and a person close to CME said the new incentives level the field. However, others raised concern it would concentrate the market. “They are trying to incentivise people to trade more,” said an oil trader. “What they’re going to end up with is quite possibly fewer, but bigger, traders”. CME said: “We regularly review programmes relative to market and other developments and may modify program components or structures in an attempt to respond to those developments.” Rebates are a common way to build volume in new futures contracts. But they have recently caught the eye of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is reviewing how they work and who receives them. Virtu Financial, an electronic trading firm, disclosed this year that the futures commission was looking into its participation in some exchange incentive programmes. Virtu declined to comment. The exchange operator has kept details of the programme private, requesting an exemption from disclosure requirements when it informed regulators of the plan.

Ak si prejdete internet tak zistíte o dolovaní viac, ja dodám, že je prakticky nereálne aby bežný človek mal doma techniku, ktorá by mu dolovanie zabezpečila. Na elektrine by minul viac než by vydoloval a tak je súčasným trendom investovať do ťažobnej sily.Nadpis naznačuje možnosť ako ťažiť bez toho aby ste investovali čo i len cent. Ja som našiel viacero možností, ale nebolo to tak ako sa to na prvý pohľad zdalo, lebo skôr či neskôr to chcelo niečo investovať.Prešiel som si viac recenzií a jednou z najefektívnejších spoločností kde si môžete zakúpiť ťažobnú silu je CEX .

Akonáhle kúpite, ťažíte, veĺmi efektívne a ak som správne pochopil informácie na stránke, ťažíte viacero cryptomien naraz. Na tejto stránke tiež môžete kupovať a predávať jednotlivé cryptomeny a na záver aj USD. Existuje u nich aj možnosť ako si USD priamo vybrať, ale to už potom vyžaduje presnú procedúru o ktorej sa dočítate. Takže jednoduchšie je to všetko dostať napríklad na BTC, tie si previsť do peňaženky a cez zmenárne si to predať a previesť na EUR.Ja som však písal, že existuje spôsob ako sa k tejto minimálnej čiastke dostať bez toho aby ste zo svojej skutočnej peňaženky vytiahli čo i len cent.

Môžete si ich pripísať každých 5 min a je ich cca 75 Satoshi za tých 5 min. Akurát čím dlhšie beží iba čas, tým ich pribúdanie je pomalšie. Takže treba zvoliť správnu stratégiu. To som odpozoroval, nikde som na ich stránke nenašiel, ako to je, akurát že vyplácajú tiež raz týždenne všetko čo ste našetrili.Land of BITCOIN – toto je súhrnný sprievodca, kde je cca 100 stránok, kde získavate úplne jednoducho od 10 Satoshi po 200 Satoshi.

Vyskúšal som si to a za hodinu keď som ich všetky obišiel som ich nazbieral cca 15000 Satoshi. Ale je to pracné. BTC sa Vám počítajú okamžite na Microwallet a už môžem potvrdiť, že je to skutočne tak, že aj z Microwallet Vám poctivo všetky BTC prídu na peňaženku.Takže ak to všetko spočítam, a ak sa tomu povenujete, za jeden deň intenzívnym zbieraním nazbierať aj 100 000 Satoshi.

Uvádzam iba to čo som sám overil.Čo je však najdôležitejšie, potrebujete BTC peňaženku. A ako som uviedol vyššie aj DOGE peňaženku. Odporúčam si ich inštalovať v mobile, nájdete ich hravo ako Bitcoin wallet a Doge wallet. V mobile je to dobré hlavne preto, že na prevody potom stačí scanovať kód nie vypisovať pracne ten komplikovaný reťazec peňaženky.Verím, že toho koho cryptomeny zaujímajú tento článok prevedie základom.

""We solve this problem with a simple, fast and elegant solution, that\'s easy for users and easy for vendors.”World changerAzteco\'s vouchers are bought over the counter for cash and can be redeemed with any bitcoin address. Additionally, they are simple for vendors to dispense, requiring just a computer, web access and a printer, removing the need for any specialised equipment.""Bitcoin is set to change the way people send money globally,"" Fernandez continued, ""and this will be especially powerful and transforming for the third-world diaspora, eliminating the financial network access problems that plague the unbanked, helping them to break out of the poverty cycle.""Fernandez argued that what he calls the “bitcoin wave” started with retailer adoption, and saw many bitcoin users chasing a handful of retailers willing to accept the cryptocurrency. While adoption is increasing, Fernandez said he still sees a problem with bringing bitcoin to the masses, explaining:""Currently, getting bitcoin is still hard. Azteco makes it very easy, and it is also very fast. There are no unnecessary interrupting steps in Azteco. Using bitcoin is no more difficult than sending a text message from your mobile phone. Everyone would laugh at the idea of a centralized text messaging service where you have to manually log in to send a text; Azteco goes one step further, removing the need for a mobile phone altogether.""\'Password fatigue\'Fernandez pointed out that many of the world’s 2.2 billion unbanked people do not have a smartphone, yet they need a way to access the latest payments technologies and employ them in e-commerce markets.People are impatient, he added. Azteco noticed that people were not concerned about not having to sign up and even liked that they don\'t have to, according to the founder.""There is a lot of username and password fatigue out there, and we tap into this animus by not requiring it,"" he said.He added:""Fees are 4%, and we are very fast – 60 seconds on average – and we\'re getting faster. There is no sign up, no waiting period, and no customer verification. You pay for your voucher and get your bitcoin immediately, just like topping up a \'pay as you go\' mobile phone.""The company, which opened London’s first bitcoin voucher shop last February, said potential vendors can rest assured that they are not exposed to any risk.""Our vendors are protected by a three-way agreement where top London law firm Keystone Law holds the vendor bonds securely. These bonds are 100% returnable to the vendor. Rather than spend thousands on an ATM, our vendors can use that money immediately to start selling bitcoin across all their sites, simultaneously, risk free,"" Fernandez said.African remittancesXoin is taking a similar approach, making bitcoin available through prepaid vouchers and gift cards, but specifically targetting young South Africans.“The unbanked markets, especially teenagers with mobile phones in Africa, are entirely excluded from e-commerce,"" Xoin co-founder Helghardt Avenant told Venture Burn. ""Bitcoin makes e-commerce more accessible to these markets, especially when it comes to virtual goods.”Xoin said that its service was designed for new bitcoin users. The service includes a pre-loaded wallet with the face value of each voucher.The vouchers can be purchased from merchants using cash. Customers then scan the code using a smartphone and redeem their bitcoins. The service uses the South African BitX exchange and its real-time exchange rate. For the time being, it is web-based only.Xoin said that its service enables all vendors to become bitcoin ATMs at a much lower cost than currently available ATMs. The team demonstrated the functionality by setting up a doughnut shop in the street.Avenant told CoinDesk that the Xoin team is trying to solve a glaring problem for bitcoin: limited accessibility for the unbanked population.He also said the company is not charging any fees for the time being and meets regularly with its merchants for feedback, adding:""The local merchants on Stellenbosch campus have agreed to take part in the experimental phase and are currently selling Xoin prepaid bitcoin without earning commission. In the future we will charge a fee of 7%. The reseller earns 4% commission. The exchange takes 1% and Xoin takes 1%. The remaining 1% goes to the actual printing cost.""The self-funded company was launched by Stellenbosch University postgraduates, and hopes to use the campus to exercise its word-of-mouth marketing.“Students come from all over the country,"" said Avenant. ""We hope that they do the work to spread the word of Xoin when they return to their homes.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Many residents in his community were stuck powerless until the local utility company restored the grid, while some subsisted on solar energy. It was after that, Levy said, that he sought a solution and came upon GoTenna.The gadget -- a small Bluetooth-enabled rod packed to the brim with modern radio innards -- lets you create your own private, secure communication network for sending messages without cell service using your smartphone. Though marketed toward outdoors and emergency situations like hiking and disaster relief, GoTenna is getting a boost from the cryptography community. Levy, whose neighborhood gets little to zero reliable cell service, happens to represent both. He\'s among the more than 25 percent of GoTenna preorder customers who paid for the product with the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.""We do not need to be dependent on centralized industries for our communication, which is a very important part of our modern lives,"" Levy told CNET. The developer runs WebOfTrust.net, a peer-to-peer credit and collaboration-focused social network currently in development that aims to take the decentralization and financial empowerment elements of Bitcoin and apply them to his local community in Hawaii. He\'s considering integrating with GoTenna using the company\'s software development kit (API) to link the gadget with his Web platform.""With GoTenna, we can create our own, decentralized mesh network that we own, and be in control of the data that we create,"" he said. Levy said he wouldn\'t have purchased GoTenna had the company not accepted Bitcoin as payment, nor if the device\'s communication lines had not been end-to-end encrypted and the messages never stored, he said. ""If it proves to be useful, I would like to encourage my community to start utilizing these devices.""Chatting in dead zones, from Burning Man and beyondGoTenna, which began taking preorders for pairs of its off-the-grid communication device in July to ship this fall, represents a unique blend. Its product mixes everyday consumer needs with the modern, more niche necessities of Web-savvy users who rely on encryption to navigate our increasingly spying- and risk-fraught communications technology.While a novel accessory, GoTenna\'s multipurpose functionality is popping up more and more, especially in software. Mobile apps like FireChat and the Serval Mesh let users create mesh networks -- a way to rig together smartphone communication links via Bluetooth, like daisychaining USB or Ethernet cables -- for communicating without cell service as well, though at far shorter ranges. GoTenna, which does not use mesh networking technology and instead sends messages on a distinct and separate radio wave frequency, works up to 50 miles at high elevations and nine miles in most outdoor scenarios.Screenshot by Nick Statt/CNETFireChat\'s developer, OpenGarden, regularly orchestrates campaigns to get FireChat up and running at events like large-scale music festivals and off-the-grid retreats like Burning Man. Yet all the while FireChat also offers encryption enthusiasts a tool for speaking beyond the eyes of Verizon, Google or the National Security Agency.Point the finger at whistle-blower Edward Snowden\'s bombshell NSA leaks last year or at the seemingly never-ending onslaught of hacks threatening our largest institutions and retail stores. Whichever is sending the loudest message, it\'s now clear that encryption is no longer something reserved for the paranoid or the hacker and security communities.""People have begun contacting us much more about encryption tools, whether it\'s the people who are inventing private-messaging tools and devices or people asking for comment on them from the press,"" said Seth Schoen, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ""We\'ve heard from people who\'ve said that they were inspired by the Snowden revelations to create privacy tools. In that sense there is a definite uptick.""GoTenna\'s dual purposeGoTenna pairs with your smartphone and lets you send text messages and location data through an app to other users of the device, which is why the gadget is sold in pairs. The messages are end-to-end encrypted using public-private key encryption, the company said, the same method that protects e-commerce transactions on the Internet.The catch: GoTenna was designed for everyday consumers, but with some wiggle room. On one hand, it was meant to be a device that wouldn\'t have to rely on gadget-loving early adopters and would instead appeal more to people in situations like Gregg Berkholtz, a datacenter consultant living in Portland, Ore.Though quite tech savvy, Berkholtz -- a regular backpacker who also takes disaster preparedness measures -- can\'t reliably use walkie-talkies. ""Having a profound hearing loss, and with a cochlear implant in my near future, a method for reliable off-grid communications is high on my goals list,"" Berkholtz told CNET. That makes a smartphone text messaging device a no-brainer, regardless of encryption.""Certainly the feedback that we\'re getting now is validating a lot of the assumptions that we were going on before,"" said GoTenna chief Daniela Perdomo. ""It was interesting to see that even communities that aren\'t normally on the bleeding edge of technology buying GoTenna. But if you\'re solving a problem that is real to them, they\'re going to come out of the woodwork, whether it\'s a cabin in Montana or the wilderness of Alaska.""However, Perdomo, with the expertise of her brother and co-founder Jorge -- a systems architect and GoTenna\'s CTO -- figured that if they accepted Bitcoins and advertised the device\'s encryption perk, it might appeal to certain subsets of the crypto community. That would allow GoTenna to appeal to people like Levy who may or may not have a need for off-the-grid communication but are nonetheless interested in taking handheld encryption on the go.""If you\'re solving a problem that is real to them, they\'re going to come out of the woodwork."" Daniela Perdomo, GoTenna CEO""I definitely don\'t think there\'s one way to use it,"" Perdomo said. Though that makes GoTenna hard to market sometimes, she admits, it means that instead of being restricted to a few use cases, the device could be co-opted by all kinds of enthusiasts and used however they see fit.""Bitcoiners quickly understand GoTenna\'s technology and appreciate our commitment to privacy and decentralization,"" Perdomo told CoinDesk in July.The strength of the cryptography helps too. GoTenna uses 224-bit elliptic curve encryption, an advanced cryptographic algorithm that, depending on how it\'s used, can be safer than other, more standard methods like RSA. The company strengthened GoTenna\'s protection by using two-factor identification, meaning only those who can access the device associated with their phone number can begin receiving and sending messages using GoTenna. Furthermore, the app gives users the control, using public keys to encrypt messages but private ones to decipher them once they\'re received.""This method allows each individual GoTenna user to have their own unique set of key ciphers,"" Jorge Perdomo explained in an email exchange with CNET. That\'s important because it means that hacking one GoTenna doesn\'t create vulnerabilities in every device. ""In a way, even our encryption could be said to be decentralized,"" he added.Update at 6:40 p.m. PT: Clarified that GoTenna does not rely on mesh networking to send messages from one device to another.Update at 11:20 a.m. PT, Monday, Sept. 8: A previous version of this article said that GoTenna\'s platform contained a public API; the company has a SDK, not an API. A quote was incorrectly attributed to Jorge Perdomo when it should have been attributed to Daniela Perdomo.', 'Jeevan Vasagar in Essen SEPTEMBER 7, 2014 7 Power prices paid by Germany’s Mittelstand companies have reached twice the level facing some of their US rivals, a study has shown, underlining the threat posed to the country’s competitiveness by its shift to renewable energy.

Z času na čas vyrolujete aj 4000 Satoshi, ale ako vravím, istota je 400DOGE zdarma – každú hodinu môžete získať minimálne cca 10 DOGE, čo je cca 400 Satoshi, platí vlastne to isté čo som písal vyššie. Je dobré to zaradiť, lebo na CEXe si prevediete DOGE na BTC úplne jednoduchoZEBRA – každú hodinu minimálne 100 Satoshi, ale moja skúsenosť je, že dosť často získate 200 ale dokonca 1000, vyplácajú pravidelne na konci týždňa. Na tejto stránke nie je možné si to dať vyplatiť kedy chcete, ale vyplácajú. Mám to overené.MOON – tu jednoducho beží čas. Ako som si všimol, či je počítač zapnutý alebo nie. jednoducho ako sa prihlásite peňaženkou, tak beží čas a Vám pribúdajú Satoshi. Môžete si ich pripísať každých 5 min a je ich cca 75 Satoshi za tých 5 min. Akurát čím dlhšie beží iba čas, tým ich pribúdanie je pomalšie. Takže treba zvoliť správnu stratégiu. To som odpozoroval, nikde som na ich stránke nenašiel, ako to je, akurát že vyplácajú tiež raz týždenne všetko čo ste našetrili.Land of BITCOIN – toto je súhrnný sprievodca, kde je cca 100 stránok, kde získavate úplne jednoducho od 10 Satoshi po 200 Satoshi. Na tejto stránke, môžete ísť od stránky po stránku, počíta Vám to aj čas od posledného rollovania, takže akonáhle uplynie upozorní Vás, že už môžete zas. Vyskúšal som si to a za hodinu keď som ich všetky obišiel som ich nazbieral cca 15000 Satoshi. Ale je to pracné. BTC sa Vám počítajú okamžite na Microwallet a už môžem potvrdiť, že je to skutočne tak, že aj z Microwallet Vám poctivo všetky BTC prídu na peňaženku.Takže ak to všetko spočítam, a ak sa tomu povenujete, za jeden deň intenzívnym zbieraním nazbierať aj 100 000 Satoshi. A ak si pozriete vyššie, stačia Vám na zakúpenie dolovacej sily 3 dni intenzívneho naháňania Satoshi. Kto nemá dosť času, stačí z času na čas ale ide to. Uvádzam iba to čo som sám overil.Čo je však najdôležitejšie, potrebujete BTC peňaženku. A ako som uviedol vyššie aj DOGE peňaženku. Odporúčam si ich inštalovať v mobile, nájdete ich hravo ako Bitcoin wallet a Doge wallet. V mobile je to dobré hlavne preto, že na prevody potom stačí scanovať kód nie vypisovať pracne ten komplikovaný reťazec peňaženky.Verím, že toho koho cryptomeny zaujímajú tento článok prevedie základom. Koho nie, nech to nečíta.Tu som zhrnul moje doterajšie skúsenosti, takže predchádzajúce blogy sú zbytočné.Veľa šťastia ak sa rozhodnete.']"

09/13/2014,"['Two years ago, Zach Harvey and his brother, Josh, were saddled with a failing guitar shop selling vintage and handmade pieces in New Hampshire. The guitar venture had once been a roaring success, but that had been in Tel Aviv, before the duo decided to move back to the United States.On the verge of shutting down the company, the brothers started casting around for a new project to take their minds off the struggling business. They had come across bitcoin before, in 2011, but did nothing more with it besides deciding that they would accept bitcoin payments for their guitars.Now, they decided to try and solve the problem of buying bitcoin. It was too complicated. They built a prototype of a machine that would dispense bitcoin in exchange for fiat. It was essentially a wooden box filled with components purchased on eBay. Harvey recalls:""We took it to a libertarian forum in New Hampshire and immediately people were all over the machine. Bitcoin became something that people were interacting with, that they could physically see. It kind of erupted at that point.""The Harveys have parlayed that prototype into Lamassu Bitcoin Ventures, the bitcoin ATM manufacturer with the largest share of an exploding, and perhaps the most visible, segment of the cryptocurrency economy. While Lamassu may be on top now, its early rival Robocoin and well-funded new entrants are piling into this rapidly changing sector.Pioneering manufacturersThe first bitcoin ATM to be used commercially was a unit by Las Vegas-based manufacturer Robocoin. It was installed in Vancouver\'s Waves coffee house at the end of October 2013, lending the place a sci-fi vibe as customers lined up to buy cryptocurrency.A month had barely passed before the news got out that the machine had already grossed more than $1m Canadian dollars, breaking even for its operator after just 17 days. The bitcoin ATM gold-rush had begun.At the start, ATM manufacturing was dominated by two firms, Robocoin and Lamassu, each with seemingly opposing approaches to the business.Robocoin machines are large, freestanding, machines with built-in palm-scanners. They allow two-way transactions between fiat and bitcoin, with each machine costing about $15,000. Lamassu units are compact, white machines that sit on a table-top. They cost $6,500 each and only allow users to buy bitcoin.The differences don\'t end there. While Robocoin machines require operators to use the Bitstamp exchange, Lamassu customers are free to choose an exchange. Robocoin also charges a 1% fee for transactions completed.Robocoin has started modelling itself after a bank, calling its machines \'branches\', while Lamassu has moved to an open-source software model.Early stumbling blocksBoth pioneers have run into stumbling blocks as their machines left the factory floor to be installed in restaurants, cafes and bars around the world. The Robocoin machine in the Waves coffee house, for example, left dozens of angry customers with unprocessed orders in January as a problem cropped up with Bitstamp, which was the only exchange the machine could use.Lamassu, meanwhile, inadvertantly turned a customer into a competitor when Tim Schuuman, owner of the eighth Lamassu unit, became unhappy because the firm wouldn\'t open-source its software. Upon receiving his Lamassu unit, Schuuman was sufficiently indignant to start work on his own open-source ATM, which is now the low-cost Skyhook machine.One operator is Jonathan Harrison of London\'s SatoshiPoint. His favoured brand is clear: his firm owns four Robocoin machines and a Lamassu unit. Still, he said, things are changing:""Lamassu is sort of marching towards [Robocoin] and they\'re going to have to do something. We have to pay Robocoin 1% of every transaction as well. With Lamassu it\'s nothing.""ATMs outside the bitcoin bubbleEven as the two incumbents were locked in a battle for market-share and to hit shipping deadlines, strong new competitors have entered the space, and no wonder, because the global ATM industry is a multi-billion dollar business.There are 2.6 million ATMs in operation around the world, according to consulting firm Retail Banking Research (RBR). That number is accelerating, driven by huge demand from Asia. India, for example, grew its installed base of ATMs by 44% in 2012 compared to a year earlier, RBR has found.You only need to look at the revenues of the handful of giant companies that dominate traditional ATM manufacturing to see the size of the opportunity for bitcoin\'s fledging makers.The biggest of these is Ohio-based NCR Corporation, which commands 30% of the global installed base, according to RBR. Last year, the NYSE-listed company reported revenues of $3.1bn for its financial services segment, which includes ATM hardware, software and installations.Its rival Diebold, also based in Ohio, reported sales of $2.3bn from its ATM business last year. Between them, the two companies employ 45,300 employees around the world.Convergence with fiat ATM networksTwo of the most ambitious new entrants in the bitcoin ATM world are BitAccess, a Canadian outfit that recently exited the prestigious Silicon Valley incubator Y Combinator, and Skyhook.Haseeb Awan is one of four co-founders at BitAccess. The firm has 46 machines installed. Awan describes an ambitious strategy to tap existing ATM networks and big banks. He says the startup is already on its way.Awan says his firm\'s model of providing a turnkey solution to operators will help it win business from operators of existing ATM networks. His firm will deal with compliance issues, the logistics of moving cash and the machines\' hardware and software.He said:""The traditional ATM industry is in danger right now, there are ATMs on every corner. Bitcoin machines can do huge transactions and they are more lucrative. We are in touch with all the major companies right now.""Fiat ATM networks are operated either by banks or what are called independent deployers. Bank networks dominate the segment in most countries, with the notable exception of the United States, where independent deployers have just over half the market, according to figures from the National ATM Council.Payment Alliance International, based in Kentucky, is the largest independent deployer in North America. The privately held company runs 60,000 ATMs or about 15% of the US installed base.Open-source slashes pricesAt the other end of the market is Skyhook, which offers the cheapest machine on the market, priced at $999. It\'s made in Oregon and runs on open-source software. The machine is relatively simple; it only allows users to buy bitcoin. It\'s a small white block meant for table-tops with a touchscreen mounted on it.Schuuman, who co-founded the startup with Jon Hannis, believes that letting customers audit the code is the best way to grow the company and increase trust in bitcoin. Besides, it\'s cheaper to develop it that way and it\'s putting price pressure on other manufacturers.He said:""We just have simpler hardware and open-source software. We likely have lower margins [than competitors], but if we do put downward pressure on other manufacturers – great. The more open and available technologies like this become, the more bitcoin as a whole benefits.""For ATM operators like SatoshiPoint\'s Harrison, the stiffer competition among manufacturers is a welcome development. He said he\'s taking a close look at a BitAccess machine for the future.""I think these new machines that have shown up, they\'re a lot cheaper and they\'re being very aggressive with their pricing as well,"" he said.The fiat ATM industry takes noticeThe fiat ATM industry is starting to take notice of the cryptocurrency space. The ATM Industry Association released a position paper on bitcoin ATMs this month, calling for greater regulation and welcoming bitcoin ATM operators into the fold.Bitcoin companies are biting. Michael Lee, who heads the association, said he expects several bitcoin ATM firms to become members in the coming weeks, following outreach efforts by his organisation.""Only through communication and relationship-building with innovators can we all seamlessly adjust to this new development,"" he said.Felix Kronabetter, marketing manager at RBR, which publishes the definitive forecasts on the ATM industry, offered a less optimistic assessment of the budding bitcoin ATM sector, saying:""Bitcoin ATMs won\'t have any impact. My understanding is that the machines are not even proper ATMs made by the major manufactures, so it\'s a niche application at the moment.""Will bitcoin ATMs stay relevant?While bitcoin ATMs have played a crucial role in creating a tangible interface to the ethereal cryptocurrency economy, are they here to stay? Or will they go the way of transitional technologies of the past, joining the Minidisc, Dictaphone and Betamax video cassettes in the graveyard of once cutting-edge tech, as phablets and mobile wallets flourish?Mitchell Demeter of Bitcoiniacs, which operates the first bitcoin ATM, at Waves coffee house in Vancouver, doesn\'t think so. He sums up the appeal of a machine specifically designed for buying a digital currency:""For a lot of people we’re the first contact they have with bitcoin. A lot of people do research online but they don’t have anyone physically to talk to. They find that a huge advantage.""Featured image via Flickr / 23912576@N05The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In a radical rethink of the traditional you-come-to-us design business model, Möbler offers customers, wherever they are, an interactive design service that is conducted and settled online.Möbler’s ability to deliver customer designs to anywhere in the world was born from the dual benefits ofmodern industry’s ability to manufacture from CAD file, and Bitcoin’s facility of effortless cross-border transactions.Hence, the company can zero in on customers’ exact vision for design via an online interactive process and finally, deliver industry standard design files for manufacture at a facility in the customer’s geographic area. From a lounging sofa to trader’s desk, and from an office park in Mozambique to a fried chicken outlet in Zambia – anything you imagine can be designed, converted to a rendering format and manufactured in your locality.At first glance, Möbler’s Concept-to-Real-World service could have worked without Bitcoin, only it would have lacked the ease, security and trustless transactions made possible by the Bitcoin payment protocol. The company’s pioneering step of decoupling design from manufacture is a logical companion to the ease and freedom offered by Bitcoin. It means that searching for that elusive piece of home or office furniture is no longer necessary – simply contact Möbler, describe it, interactively refine it, have it made locally, and pay with bitcoins!CCN spoke with Möbler’s CEO, Markus Root, about the service, about how he arrived at this novel approach and his thoughts surrounding Bitcoin.During our initial discussion, you mentioned that you had recently grasped the significance of Bitcoin. It’s an exciting moment when the lightbulb first switches on, so, can you tell readers what your impressions and thoughts are? What about Bitcoin excites you most?I really like the Bitcoin motto “Be Your Own Bank” – I’m for anything that puts the power back in the citizens’ hands.Go ahead and tell readers about your company, Möbler, and its services. Where has it come from and where is it going?Möbler started out as a designer / maker workshop. We stopped manufacturing items and chose, instead, to focus on the design service only. Möbler recently branched out to include a retail and corporate interior design service which is expanding fast. We would love to design for companies such as Vitra, Herman Miller, and Ikea. Until we get there, we have added product design to our service offering, since there are many innovators out there who need casings and stylized covers for Bitcoin-related gadgets.Do you find that you get requests for design work outside of the city/province where you are based – or perhaps outside of your country – and how does this impact on job delivery and invoicing?Yes, we do – and due to modern technology we can pretty much take on work from anywhere in the world. The first obstacle to be removed was Delivery. We realized clients are willing and able to use local manufacturers and suppliers for the designs Möbler creates. Invoicing, however, posed a challenge – mostly due to factors such as exchange rates, transfer fees and banking delays.Right, some of those challenges must have been what led the company to accepting Bitcoin payments?Yes, and the ability to make fast, effortless payments via Bitcoin removes all of the settlement headaches for both us and our clients. Most of the risk associated with the design and delivery process simply falls away, because we are able to do our work with the knowledge that payment has been secured via our BitGo wallet using a multisig transaction. Equally, the client is not left wondering what they’re going to receive in exchange for their money, because they can approve and influence the design as it evolves. To my mind, Bitcoin abounds with opportunity and events such as the launch of the very first Bitcoin ATM in Africa, means Bitcoin is gaining sufficient momentum to make it impossible to ignore.In the South African design and architecture industry, is there much local awareness of Bitcoin and its benefits as a payment system? Do you think these benefits could cascade downwards to builders and the rest of the construction industry?Unfortunately, South-Africa always seems to be a step or two behind when it comes to the adoption of new technology (although we do think this is changing.) I can only imagine that Bitcoin will have a huge impact on the industry. For example, Bitcoin would make a very good alternative payment system for the many workers in the South African labor force – most of whom do not operate bank accounts. There are a lot of offerings from local banks that try to capitalise on this (via cellphone banking & services such as ABSA’s CashSend & FNB’s eWallet) but, of course, they always take their slice of the pie.In today’s inter-connected world, what motivations are there for individuals and businesses to outsource design work away from their immediate geographic area?Modern technology has removed the constraints that this would have imposed in the past. Clients can now match their needs for each job to the correct designer regardless of where in the world they find themselves. In other words, they have more options and can find the best possible fit for the project.I imagine that, in the design industry, there must be frequent dilemmas of expectation versus delivery (smiles). What are the stages that Möbler’s design process goes through to ensure customers get what they want?We typically start with a conversation to discuss your needs and expectations of the project – goals, timelines, budgets, and so forth.

A chaque fois qu’un particulier voudra créditer son compte en mipys, il obtiendra 110 mipys pour 100 euros versés, soit un bonus de 10%"", explique Pierre Poujade. ""Pour les professionnels, cette monnaie devrait leur permettre de capter de nouveaux marchés comme en Belgique, où le chiffre d’affaires supplémentaire généré par le res est de 5 à 10%.""Pour l’élu régional, le but ""n’est pas de lancer une monnaie alternative à l’euro mais une monnaie complémentaire qui remette l’humain au centre d’un projet économique de proximité et qui remplisse des fonctions que ne remplissent pas les monnaies officielles, comme de générer de l’emploi local"".""Comme le res belge, la monnaie mipys est entièrement numérique, comme le wir elle aura une vocation bancaire en accordant des prêts à taux zéro, comme les miles des compagnies aériennes, elle aura une fonction de carte de fidélité"", précise Pierre Poujade, qui estime à 20.000 le nombre d’usagers nécessaires pour ""faire tourner cette monnaie"".PROFUSION DE MONNAIES RÉGIONALESD’autres monnaies locales citoyennes à parité avec l’euro ont déjà fait leur apparition et s’échangent sous forme de coupons-billets comme la touselle en Haute-Garonne, le sol-olympe à Montauban, dans le Tarn-et-Garonne, le céou à Gourdon, dans le Lot ou le pyrène en Ariège, lancé en juillet dernier.A Toulouse, le sol-violette, mis en circulation en mai 2011 avec le soutien de la municipalité, remporte un vif succès.Cette monnaie compte aujourd’hui 1.800 utilisateurs qui peuvent consommer auprès de 153 magasins ou associations de l’économie sociale et solidaire. Quelque 60.000 sols sont aujourd’hui en circulation et ont généré un chiffre d’affaires de 360.000 sols-violette dans le réseau utilisateur.""Toutes ces initiatives montrent la vitalité et le besoin des citoyens de s’approprier la question monétaire pour remettre la finance au service de l’économie réelle et restreindre les capacités à spéculer des marchés financiers"", estime Andrea Caro, cofondatrice et coordinatrice du projet sol-violette.""Mais la question de la coexistence de ces monnaies locales va très vite se poser. Il va falloir réfléchir à leur convergence pour un passage à plus grande échelle, sans qu’elles y perdent leur âme"", ajoute-t-elle.(Edité par Yves Clarisse)', 'Editor’s note: Joe Lonsdale is a general partner at Formation 8.Early last year, I wrote an article explaining how our team views the concept of duty for leaders in the technology ecosystem. We believe that this duty involves looking beyond conventional startups to study complex industries and using technology to tackle the biggest problems we can find.Our belief is based on an observation that many of the large industries in the U.S. are in some form of crisis, but few top technologists — and few investors — set their sights on fixing the parts of our economy that could have the greatest impact on overall prosperity and well-being (financial services, healthcare systems, government, education, agriculture, logistics, etc.).Not so long ago only a few of us in Silicon Valley were building companies in these areas, but now we’re happy to see more and more entrepreneurs applying technology to hard problems in huge industries that will have lasting effects for people across the globe.We think that Silicon Valley is at the very beginning of this important wave of innovation, and at Formation 8 we have partnered with dozens of these companies because we believe that improving these industries will enable general prosperity while also providing for the highest returns. Our philosophy is that many companies that present the greatest economic opportunity are also those that create the most value for society.However, there are clear exceptions to this rule. In certain cases, market incentives fail to align, or even exacerbate an issue – and mission-driven non-profit organizations are needed to solve the problem. Technology is playing an increasingly critical role in these organizations and they are badly in need of our help.The problem of child exploitation is a glaring example of such a scenario. Economic motivation has created a perverse and underground marketplace where children are bought and sold as slaves. It’s a harsh reality that exists in our own backyards, with thousands of children in the US alone – many from the foster care system or from broken families – being commercially exploited every year.Many of these individuals are coerced into prostitution as teenagers, long before they are legally old enough to consent to sex. The average age at which girls are forced into this exploitation is 13, and this illicit market is growing and is now second only to drug trafficking, according to research from the Ashton Kutcher-backed non-profit, Thorn. So far, the US government has been just as successful in stopping exploitation as they’ve been with drugs, and they need our help.As with every other market, the proliferation of the Internet has driven activity online. Today these children are bought and sold on many of the same sites where you can source a roommate, sell your bike or find a job. Further, connectivity has also spurred an explosion in the online trade of child sexual abuse imagery. Peer-to-peer platforms and anonymous networks like Tor allow images and videos of the most egregious types of abuse to be traded globally, continuously re-victimizing these children and creating networks of people who connect with one another to share content and justify their behavior to one another.There’s no economic incentive in trying to stop the spread of this content or to use the digital trail to identify more victims and stop the abuse, but there’s definitely a moral one.The team at Thorn has extremely passionate and talented individuals who partner with government organizations and leading software and new media companies, and work with child exploitation experts to save children and attack the problem from multiple angles. Thorn’s partners include Facebook, Palantir, Google, Twitter, Microsoft, Salesforce, Tumblr, Twilio, SV Angel, Formation 8, and others.While the financial support of Ashton and these allies is valuable, their technological expertise is invaluable. From machine learning to detect patterns in perpetrator behavior to complex data integration to the design of simple and useful UX, backed by tools such as semantic classifiers, for law enforcers to prioritize cases on online escort boards that may involve minors, it’s technology that’s providing new tools to fight back against these predators.Formation 8 recently helped Thorn organize a hackathon, gathering nearly a hundred talented computer scientists at Twilio’s offices in San Francisco to participate in fighting child exploitation.Joining Ashton and myself other judges included: Del Harvey (VP Trust & Safety at Twitter); Ellen Levy (Managing Director, Silicon Valley Connect); Megan Smith (recently named incoming CTO of the United States); and Ilya Grigorik (Web Performance at Google).Engineers worked hand-in-hand with Thorn’s subject matter experts to develop a variety of tools that could be potentially used by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), law enforcement agencies, and other non-profit or government organizations tasked with working on these sorts of issues.While there has been some public criticism of faulty statistics around child exploitation and trafficking, after interacting with the experts and others at Thorn and viewing the log data about U.S.-based searches for child-exploitation for context, it was clear to everybody how serious and widespread of an issue this is.The event was hugely successful, with winning projects including visualization layers of perpetrator activity, databases of ontologies specific to child exploitation, and discovery methods for potential predators using bitcoin to pay for child sexual exploitation content.These projects, along with many others, can be put to use almost immediately and the energy and creativity we saw these teams bring to bear on this serious issue was inspiring to all of us.Traditional hackathons are fun and focused on skill and competition, but we believe that events which focus on the positive social impact of technology engage a wider and more diverse set of participants.Lilli Oetting, who won second place with her partner Bowen Lu said this was the first hackathon she has ever competed in. “Hacking for the sake of hacking isn’t at all motivational to me, but hacking to diagnose a disease or catch terrorists or save a child from sexual exploitation is a great honor as well as an exciting technical challenge. In my experience, many women share the mindset that technology is most interesting in its application to social problems.”Oetting, who is a rising senior at Stanford studying computer science, noted that this further substantiated earlier observations she had while teaching a class titled Code the Change: Learn Web Development Through Nonprofit Projects. “It was by far the most gender-balanced computer science class I’ve been a part of,” she said. “Over half the students were female.”We hope we can continue to highlight additional amazing role models in our community who are not only very respected technologists and leaders, but are engaged in great social causes. We want to inspire everyone to recognize the positive social impact they can have if they choose to become technologists.Ashton’s leadership on this issue continues to be inspiring – at the end of the hackathon he announced that he’s sponsoring three $100,000 fellowships for data scientists and software engineers who want to continue working with Thorn. We’re excited to see what can be accomplished with that kind of team, given how much progress was made in just a weekend.The reality is technologists hold great power in the world, and not only does big industry need our help right now, but so do a lot of the most important causes. My first company, Palantir, has also engaged in anti-child exploitation technology work pro bono with NCMEC, a variety of anti-human trafficking work, as well as other pro bono technology-enabled causes such as sophisticated disaster relief in Haiti, Philippines, and elsewhere with the Clinton Global Initiative.I’ve also been inspired by the philanthropy work at Salesforce, Google, and other companies. While it can be overwhelming to realize how many problems there are to solve in the world, it’s always inspiring to see so many talented people willing to spend their time and energy in hopes of making a difference. We are tremendously appreciative of the work our hackathon participants did in hopes of potentially rescuing even just one child from exploitation; we believe the work that was done will save many.We urge any technologists who might be reading this – and the leaders in our community – to think about what you are working on, and how that is impacting those around you. There are few other communities who have ever had similar potential to create widespread and scalable progress, or to positively impact so many lives.We might remember an important quote from our civilization’s past: “From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.”We sit at a very unique place in history, and I hope that our peers in Silicon Valley will continue to remind and inspire each other about the role we can play in the world.Special thanks to Del Harvey, Julie Cordua, Claire Schmidt, Drew Oetting and Pierre Ayres in the writing and editing of this article.', ""Coinbase valis Euroopas oma panganduspartneriks LHV panga, mis tähendab, et Coinbase’i euromaksed Euroopas liiguvad LHV panga arveldusteenust kasutades. Lühidalt öeldes pakub LHV Coinbase’ile pangateenuseid Euroopas.LHV panga jaepanganduse juht Andres Kitter rõhutas, et Coinbase on USAs makseasutusena registreeritud ja reguleeritud teenusepakkuja.«Meie jaoks on äärmiselt oluline, et kogu meie tegevus vastaks seadustele ja regulatsioonidele. Teisalt peame vajalikuks, et kiiresti arenev valdkond ka mõistlikult reguleeritud saaks. Coinbase'iga koostöö eelduseks oli see, et tegemist on väga tugeva ja läbipaistvust pakkuva partneriga, kes aitab maandada mitmeid krüptorahaga seotud riske nagu isikutuvastus või rahapesu tõkestamise vajadus,» kirjeldas Kitter.Kitter selgitas, et LHV ise bitcoinidega ei kauple, vaid pakub pangateenust ettevõttele, mis tegeleb krüptorahateenusega. Siiski on LHV sel teemal Finantsinspektsiooniga suhelnud ja neid informeerinud. Lisaks on inspektsiooniga kohtunud ka Coinbase’i esindajad.«Alati leidub neid, kes ühte või teise uuendusse skeptiliselt suhtuvad. Kui krüptoraha valdkonda täpsemalt uurida, saab kiiresti selgeks, et blockchain ehk tehnoloogia, millel Bitcoin ja teised krüptorahad baseeruvad, on murranguliselt uuenduslik ja võimaldab erinevate (finants)teenuste pakkumiseks avaraid võimalusi. Tänaseks on Bitcoini tehnoloogiale juba üles ehitatud mitmeid edasiviivaid teenuseid. LHV on huvitatud just eelkõige Bitcoini tehnoloogiast ja soovime finantsmaailma uuendustega kaasas käia,» rääkis Kitter.Tänu Coinbase’i laienemisele Euroopasse saavad eurooplased nüüd bitcoine kergemini osta, müüa ja hoida. «Nagu Coinbase ise teatas, laienesid nende teenused esimese lainena 13 Euroopa riiki, kus on bitcoinidega kauplemine reguleeritud ja lubatud. Eesti ja mitmed teised riigid lisanduvad nende riikide hulka loodetavasti lähiajal,» lisas Kitter.""]","['Two years ago, Zach Harvey and his brother, Josh, were saddled with a failing guitar shop selling vintage and handmade pieces in New Hampshire. The guitar venture had once been a roaring success, but that had been in Tel Aviv, before the duo decided to move back to the United States.On the verge of shutting down the company, the brothers started casting around for a new project to take their minds off the struggling business. They had come across bitcoin before, in 2011, but did nothing more with it besides deciding that they would accept bitcoin payments for their guitars.Now, they decided to try and solve the problem of buying bitcoin. It was too complicated. They built a prototype of a machine that would dispense bitcoin in exchange for fiat. It was essentially a wooden box filled with components purchased on eBay. Harvey recalls:""We took it to a libertarian forum in New Hampshire and immediately people were all over the machine. Bitcoin became something that people were interacting with, that they could physically see. It kind of erupted at that point.""The Harveys have parlayed that prototype into Lamassu Bitcoin Ventures, the bitcoin ATM manufacturer with the largest share of an exploding, and perhaps the most visible, segment of the cryptocurrency economy. While Lamassu may be on top now, its early rival Robocoin and well-funded new entrants are piling into this rapidly changing sector.Pioneering manufacturersThe first bitcoin ATM to be used commercially was a unit by Las Vegas-based manufacturer Robocoin. It was installed in Vancouver\'s Waves coffee house at the end of October 2013, lending the place a sci-fi vibe as customers lined up to buy cryptocurrency.A month had barely passed before the news got out that the machine had already grossed more than $1m Canadian dollars, breaking even for its operator after just 17 days. The bitcoin ATM gold-rush had begun.At the start, ATM manufacturing was dominated by two firms, Robocoin and Lamassu, each with seemingly opposing approaches to the business.Robocoin machines are large, freestanding, machines with built-in palm-scanners. They allow two-way transactions between fiat and bitcoin, with each machine costing about $15,000. Lamassu units are compact, white machines that sit on a table-top. They cost $6,500 each and only allow users to buy bitcoin.The differences don\'t end there. While Robocoin machines require operators to use the Bitstamp exchange, Lamassu customers are free to choose an exchange. Robocoin also charges a 1% fee for transactions completed.Robocoin has started modelling itself after a bank, calling its machines \'branches\', while Lamassu has moved to an open-source software model.Early stumbling blocksBoth pioneers have run into stumbling blocks as their machines left the factory floor to be installed in restaurants, cafes and bars around the world. The Robocoin machine in the Waves coffee house, for example, left dozens of angry customers with unprocessed orders in January as a problem cropped up with Bitstamp, which was the only exchange the machine could use.Lamassu, meanwhile, inadvertantly turned a customer into a competitor when Tim Schuuman, owner of the eighth Lamassu unit, became unhappy because the firm wouldn\'t open-source its software. Upon receiving his Lamassu unit, Schuuman was sufficiently indignant to start work on his own open-source ATM, which is now the low-cost Skyhook machine.One operator is Jonathan Harrison of London\'s SatoshiPoint. His favoured brand is clear: his firm owns four Robocoin machines and a Lamassu unit. Still, he said, things are changing:""Lamassu is sort of marching towards [Robocoin] and they\'re going to have to do something. We have to pay Robocoin 1% of every transaction as well. With Lamassu it\'s nothing.""ATMs outside the bitcoin bubbleEven as the two incumbents were locked in a battle for market-share and to hit shipping deadlines, strong new competitors have entered the space, and no wonder, because the global ATM industry is a multi-billion dollar business.There are 2.6 million ATMs in operation around the world, according to consulting firm Retail Banking Research (RBR). That number is accelerating, driven by huge demand from Asia. India, for example, grew its installed base of ATMs by 44% in 2012 compared to a year earlier, RBR has found.You only need to look at the revenues of the handful of giant companies that dominate traditional ATM manufacturing to see the size of the opportunity for bitcoin\'s fledging makers.The biggest of these is Ohio-based NCR Corporation, which commands 30% of the global installed base, according to RBR. Last year, the NYSE-listed company reported revenues of $3.1bn for its financial services segment, which includes ATM hardware, software and installations.Its rival Diebold, also based in Ohio, reported sales of $2.3bn from its ATM business last year. Between them, the two companies employ 45,300 employees around the world.Convergence with fiat ATM networksTwo of the most ambitious new entrants in the bitcoin ATM world are BitAccess, a Canadian outfit that recently exited the prestigious Silicon Valley incubator Y Combinator, and Skyhook.Haseeb Awan is one of four co-founders at BitAccess. The firm has 46 machines installed. Awan describes an ambitious strategy to tap existing ATM networks and big banks. He says the startup is already on its way.Awan says his firm\'s model of providing a turnkey solution to operators will help it win business from operators of existing ATM networks. His firm will deal with compliance issues, the logistics of moving cash and the machines\' hardware and software.He said:""The traditional ATM industry is in danger right now, there are ATMs on every corner. Bitcoin machines can do huge transactions and they are more lucrative. We are in touch with all the major companies right now.""Fiat ATM networks are operated either by banks or what are called independent deployers. Bank networks dominate the segment in most countries, with the notable exception of the United States, where independent deployers have just over half the market, according to figures from the National ATM Council.Payment Alliance International, based in Kentucky, is the largest independent deployer in North America. The privately held company runs 60,000 ATMs or about 15% of the US installed base.Open-source slashes pricesAt the other end of the market is Skyhook, which offers the cheapest machine on the market, priced at $999. It\'s made in Oregon and runs on open-source software. The machine is relatively simple; it only allows users to buy bitcoin. It\'s a small white block meant for table-tops with a touchscreen mounted on it.Schuuman, who co-founded the startup with Jon Hannis, believes that letting customers audit the code is the best way to grow the company and increase trust in bitcoin. Besides, it\'s cheaper to develop it that way and it\'s putting price pressure on other manufacturers.He said:""We just have simpler hardware and open-source software. We likely have lower margins [than competitors], but if we do put downward pressure on other manufacturers – great. The more open and available technologies like this become, the more bitcoin as a whole benefits.""For ATM operators like SatoshiPoint\'s Harrison, the stiffer competition among manufacturers is a welcome development. He said he\'s taking a close look at a BitAccess machine for the future.""I think these new machines that have shown up, they\'re a lot cheaper and they\'re being very aggressive with their pricing as well,"" he said.The fiat ATM industry takes noticeThe fiat ATM industry is starting to take notice of the cryptocurrency space. The ATM Industry Association released a position paper on bitcoin ATMs this month, calling for greater regulation and welcoming bitcoin ATM operators into the fold.Bitcoin companies are biting. Michael Lee, who heads the association, said he expects several bitcoin ATM firms to become members in the coming weeks, following outreach efforts by his organisation.""Only through communication and relationship-building with innovators can we all seamlessly adjust to this new development,"" he said.Felix Kronabetter, marketing manager at RBR, which publishes the definitive forecasts on the ATM industry, offered a less optimistic assessment of the budding bitcoin ATM sector, saying:""Bitcoin ATMs won\'t have any impact. My understanding is that the machines are not even proper ATMs made by the major manufactures, so it\'s a niche application at the moment.""Will bitcoin ATMs stay relevant?While bitcoin ATMs have played a crucial role in creating a tangible interface to the ethereal cryptocurrency economy, are they here to stay? Or will they go the way of transitional technologies of the past, joining the Minidisc, Dictaphone and Betamax video cassettes in the graveyard of once cutting-edge tech, as phablets and mobile wallets flourish?Mitchell Demeter of Bitcoiniacs, which operates the first bitcoin ATM, at Waves coffee house in Vancouver, doesn\'t think so. He sums up the appeal of a machine specifically designed for buying a digital currency:""For a lot of people we’re the first contact they have with bitcoin. A lot of people do research online but they don’t have anyone physically to talk to. They find that a huge advantage.""Featured image via Flickr / 23912576@N05The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In a radical rethink of the traditional you-come-to-us design business model, Möbler offers customers, wherever they are, an interactive design service that is conducted and settled online.Möbler’s ability to deliver customer designs to anywhere in the world was born from the dual benefits ofmodern industry’s ability to manufacture from CAD file, and Bitcoin’s facility of effortless cross-border transactions.Hence, the company can zero in on customers’ exact vision for design via an online interactive process and finally, deliver industry standard design files for manufacture at a facility in the customer’s geographic area. From a lounging sofa to trader’s desk, and from an office park in Mozambique to a fried chicken outlet in Zambia – anything you imagine can be designed, converted to a rendering format and manufactured in your locality.At first glance, Möbler’s Concept-to-Real-World service could have worked without Bitcoin, only it would have lacked the ease, security and trustless transactions made possible by the Bitcoin payment protocol. The company’s pioneering step of decoupling design from manufacture is a logical companion to the ease and freedom offered by Bitcoin. It means that searching for that elusive piece of home or office furniture is no longer necessary – simply contact Möbler, describe it, interactively refine it, have it made locally, and pay with bitcoins!CCN spoke with Möbler’s CEO, Markus Root, about the service, about how he arrived at this novel approach and his thoughts surrounding Bitcoin.During our initial discussion, you mentioned that you had recently grasped the significance of Bitcoin. It’s an exciting moment when the lightbulb first switches on, so, can you tell readers what your impressions and thoughts are? What about Bitcoin excites you most?I really like the Bitcoin motto “Be Your Own Bank” – I’m for anything that puts the power back in the citizens’ hands.Go ahead and tell readers about your company, Möbler, and its services. Where has it come from and where is it going?Möbler started out as a designer / maker workshop. We stopped manufacturing items and chose, instead, to focus on the design service only. Möbler recently branched out to include a retail and corporate interior design service which is expanding fast. We would love to design for companies such as Vitra, Herman Miller, and Ikea. Until we get there, we have added product design to our service offering, since there are many innovators out there who need casings and stylized covers for Bitcoin-related gadgets.Do you find that you get requests for design work outside of the city/province where you are based – or perhaps outside of your country – and how does this impact on job delivery and invoicing?Yes, we do – and due to modern technology we can pretty much take on work from anywhere in the world. The first obstacle to be removed was Delivery. We realized clients are willing and able to use local manufacturers and suppliers for the designs Möbler creates. Invoicing, however, posed a challenge – mostly due to factors such as exchange rates, transfer fees and banking delays.Right, some of those challenges must have been what led the company to accepting Bitcoin payments?Yes, and the ability to make fast, effortless payments via Bitcoin removes all of the settlement headaches for both us and our clients. Most of the risk associated with the design and delivery process simply falls away, because we are able to do our work with the knowledge that payment has been secured via our BitGo wallet using a multisig transaction. Equally, the client is not left wondering what they’re going to receive in exchange for their money, because they can approve and influence the design as it evolves. To my mind, Bitcoin abounds with opportunity and events such as the launch of the very first Bitcoin ATM in Africa, means Bitcoin is gaining sufficient momentum to make it impossible to ignore.In the South African design and architecture industry, is there much local awareness of Bitcoin and its benefits as a payment system? Do you think these benefits could cascade downwards to builders and the rest of the construction industry?Unfortunately, South-Africa always seems to be a step or two behind when it comes to the adoption of new technology (although we do think this is changing.) I can only imagine that Bitcoin will have a huge impact on the industry. For example, Bitcoin would make a very good alternative payment system for the many workers in the South African labor force – most of whom do not operate bank accounts. There are a lot of offerings from local banks that try to capitalise on this (via cellphone banking & services such as ABSA’s CashSend & FNB’s eWallet) but, of course, they always take their slice of the pie.In today’s inter-connected world, what motivations are there for individuals and businesses to outsource design work away from their immediate geographic area?Modern technology has removed the constraints that this would have imposed in the past. Clients can now match their needs for each job to the correct designer regardless of where in the world they find themselves. In other words, they have more options and can find the best possible fit for the project.I imagine that, in the design industry, there must be frequent dilemmas of expectation versus delivery (smiles). What are the stages that Möbler’s design process goes through to ensure customers get what they want?We typically start with a conversation to discuss your needs and expectations of the project – goals, timelines, budgets, and so forth. This information is collated into a quote, and as soon as we’ve agreed payment terms and milestones, we start working on your design. We produce sketches to gauge whether our vision of the design matches your own. Once both parties agree that the visions match, we get stuck in and send you detailed designs.

Quelque 60.000 sols sont aujourd’hui en circulation et ont généré un chiffre d’affaires de 360.000 sols-violette dans le réseau utilisateur.""Toutes ces initiatives montrent la vitalité et le besoin des citoyens de s’approprier la question monétaire pour remettre la finance au service de l’économie réelle et restreindre les capacités à spéculer des marchés financiers"", estime Andrea Caro, cofondatrice et coordinatrice du projet sol-violette.""Mais la question de la coexistence de ces monnaies locales va très vite se poser. Il va falloir réfléchir à leur convergence pour un passage à plus grande échelle, sans qu’elles y perdent leur âme"", ajoute-t-elle.(Edité par Yves Clarisse)', 'Editor’s note: Joe Lonsdale is a general partner at Formation 8.Early last year, I wrote an article explaining how our team views the concept of duty for leaders in the technology ecosystem. We believe that this duty involves looking beyond conventional startups to study complex industries and using technology to tackle the biggest problems we can find.Our belief is based on an observation that many of the large industries in the U.S. are in some form of crisis, but few top technologists — and few investors — set their sights on fixing the parts of our economy that could have the greatest impact on overall prosperity and well-being (financial services, healthcare systems, government, education, agriculture, logistics, etc.).Not so long ago only a few of us in Silicon Valley were building companies in these areas, but now we’re happy to see more and more entrepreneurs applying technology to hard problems in huge industries that will have lasting effects for people across the globe.We think that Silicon Valley is at the very beginning of this important wave of innovation, and at Formation 8 we have partnered with dozens of these companies because we believe that improving these industries will enable general prosperity while also providing for the highest returns. Our philosophy is that many companies that present the greatest economic opportunity are also those that create the most value for society.However, there are clear exceptions to this rule. In certain cases, market incentives fail to align, or even exacerbate an issue – and mission-driven non-profit organizations are needed to solve the problem. Technology is playing an increasingly critical role in these organizations and they are badly in need of our help.The problem of child exploitation is a glaring example of such a scenario. Economic motivation has created a perverse and underground marketplace where children are bought and sold as slaves. It’s a harsh reality that exists in our own backyards, with thousands of children in the US alone – many from the foster care system or from broken families – being commercially exploited every year.Many of these individuals are coerced into prostitution as teenagers, long before they are legally old enough to consent to sex. The average age at which girls are forced into this exploitation is 13, and this illicit market is growing and is now second only to drug trafficking, according to research from the Ashton Kutcher-backed non-profit, Thorn. So far, the US government has been just as successful in stopping exploitation as they’ve been with drugs, and they need our help.As with every other market, the proliferation of the Internet has driven activity online. Today these children are bought and sold on many of the same sites where you can source a roommate, sell your bike or find a job. Further, connectivity has also spurred an explosion in the online trade of child sexual abuse imagery. Peer-to-peer platforms and anonymous networks like Tor allow images and videos of the most egregious types of abuse to be traded globally, continuously re-victimizing these children and creating networks of people who connect with one another to share content and justify their behavior to one another.There’s no economic incentive in trying to stop the spread of this content or to use the digital trail to identify more victims and stop the abuse, but there’s definitely a moral one.The team at Thorn has extremely passionate and talented individuals who partner with government organizations and leading software and new media companies, and work with child exploitation experts to save children and attack the problem from multiple angles. Thorn’s partners include Facebook, Palantir, Google, Twitter, Microsoft, Salesforce, Tumblr, Twilio, SV Angel, Formation 8, and others.While the financial support of Ashton and these allies is valuable, their technological expertise is invaluable. From machine learning to detect patterns in perpetrator behavior to complex data integration to the design of simple and useful UX, backed by tools such as semantic classifiers, for law enforcers to prioritize cases on online escort boards that may involve minors, it’s technology that’s providing new tools to fight back against these predators.Formation 8 recently helped Thorn organize a hackathon, gathering nearly a hundred talented computer scientists at Twilio’s offices in San Francisco to participate in fighting child exploitation.Joining Ashton and myself other judges included: Del Harvey (VP Trust & Safety at Twitter); Ellen Levy (Managing Director, Silicon Valley Connect); Megan Smith (recently named incoming CTO of the United States); and Ilya Grigorik (Web Performance at Google).Engineers worked hand-in-hand with Thorn’s subject matter experts to develop a variety of tools that could be potentially used by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), law enforcement agencies, and other non-profit or government organizations tasked with working on these sorts of issues.While there has been some public criticism of faulty statistics around child exploitation and trafficking, after interacting with the experts and others at Thorn and viewing the log data about U.S.-based searches for child-exploitation for context, it was clear to everybody how serious and widespread of an issue this is.The event was hugely successful, with winning projects including visualization layers of perpetrator activity, databases of ontologies specific to child exploitation, and discovery methods for potential predators using bitcoin to pay for child sexual exploitation content.These projects, along with many others, can be put to use almost immediately and the energy and creativity we saw these teams bring to bear on this serious issue was inspiring to all of us.Traditional hackathons are fun and focused on skill and competition, but we believe that events which focus on the positive social impact of technology engage a wider and more diverse set of participants.Lilli Oetting, who won second place with her partner Bowen Lu said this was the first hackathon she has ever competed in. “Hacking for the sake of hacking isn’t at all motivational to me, but hacking to diagnose a disease or catch terrorists or save a child from sexual exploitation is a great honor as well as an exciting technical challenge. In my experience, many women share the mindset that technology is most interesting in its application to social problems.”Oetting, who is a rising senior at Stanford studying computer science, noted that this further substantiated earlier observations she had while teaching a class titled Code the Change: Learn Web Development Through Nonprofit Projects. “It was by far the most gender-balanced computer science class I’ve been a part of,” she said. “Over half the students were female.”We hope we can continue to highlight additional amazing role models in our community who are not only very respected technologists and leaders, but are engaged in great social causes. We want to inspire everyone to recognize the positive social impact they can have if they choose to become technologists.Ashton’s leadership on this issue continues to be inspiring – at the end of the hackathon he announced that he’s sponsoring three $100,000 fellowships for data scientists and software engineers who want to continue working with Thorn. We’re excited to see what can be accomplished with that kind of team, given how much progress was made in just a weekend.The reality is technologists hold great power in the world, and not only does big industry need our help right now, but so do a lot of the most important causes. My first company, Palantir, has also engaged in anti-child exploitation technology work pro bono with NCMEC, a variety of anti-human trafficking work, as well as other pro bono technology-enabled causes such as sophisticated disaster relief in Haiti, Philippines, and elsewhere with the Clinton Global Initiative.I’ve also been inspired by the philanthropy work at Salesforce, Google, and other companies. While it can be overwhelming to realize how many problems there are to solve in the world, it’s always inspiring to see so many talented people willing to spend their time and energy in hopes of making a difference. We are tremendously appreciative of the work our hackathon participants did in hopes of potentially rescuing even just one child from exploitation; we believe the work that was done will save many.We urge any technologists who might be reading this – and the leaders in our community – to think about what you are working on, and how that is impacting those around you. There are few other communities who have ever had similar potential to create widespread and scalable progress, or to positively impact so many lives.We might remember an important quote from our civilization’s past: “From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.”We sit at a very unique place in history, and I hope that our peers in Silicon Valley will continue to remind and inspire each other about the role we can play in the world.Special thanks to Del Harvey, Julie Cordua, Claire Schmidt, Drew Oetting and Pierre Ayres in the writing and editing of this article.', ""Coinbase valis Euroopas oma panganduspartneriks LHV panga, mis tähendab, et Coinbase’i euromaksed Euroopas liiguvad LHV panga arveldusteenust kasutades. Lühidalt öeldes pakub LHV Coinbase’ile pangateenuseid Euroopas.LHV panga jaepanganduse juht Andres Kitter rõhutas, et Coinbase on USAs makseasutusena registreeritud ja reguleeritud teenusepakkuja.«Meie jaoks on äärmiselt oluline, et kogu meie tegevus vastaks seadustele ja regulatsioonidele. Teisalt peame vajalikuks, et kiiresti arenev valdkond ka mõistlikult reguleeritud saaks. Coinbase'iga koostöö eelduseks oli see, et tegemist on väga tugeva ja läbipaistvust pakkuva partneriga, kes aitab maandada mitmeid krüptorahaga seotud riske nagu isikutuvastus või rahapesu tõkestamise vajadus,» kirjeldas Kitter.Kitter selgitas, et LHV ise bitcoinidega ei kauple, vaid pakub pangateenust ettevõttele, mis tegeleb krüptorahateenusega. Siiski on LHV sel teemal Finantsinspektsiooniga suhelnud ja neid informeerinud. Lisaks on inspektsiooniga kohtunud ka Coinbase’i esindajad.«Alati leidub neid, kes ühte või teise uuendusse skeptiliselt suhtuvad. Kui krüptoraha valdkonda täpsemalt uurida, saab kiiresti selgeks, et blockchain ehk tehnoloogia, millel Bitcoin ja teised krüptorahad baseeruvad, on murranguliselt uuenduslik ja võimaldab erinevate (finants)teenuste pakkumiseks avaraid võimalusi. Tänaseks on Bitcoini tehnoloogiale juba üles ehitatud mitmeid edasiviivaid teenuseid. LHV on huvitatud just eelkõige Bitcoini tehnoloogiast ja soovime finantsmaailma uuendustega kaasas käia,» rääkis Kitter.Tänu Coinbase’i laienemisele Euroopasse saavad eurooplased nüüd bitcoine kergemini osta, müüa ja hoida. «Nagu Coinbase ise teatas, laienesid nende teenused esimese lainena 13 Euroopa riiki, kus on bitcoinidega kauplemine reguleeritud ja lubatud. Eesti ja mitmed teised riigid lisanduvad nende riikide hulka loodetavasti lähiajal,» lisas Kitter.""]"

09/27/2014,"['China\'s position as the most active bitcoin trading market has come to attention again as Beijing exchange OKCoin topped daily dollar trades for the first time earlier this week. This comes weeks after Shanghai exchange BTC China highlighted that yuan trades comprised more than 70% of trading volume.As Chinese exchanges jostle for the top spot in global trading volumes, yuan trading is now three times greater than dollar trades. Analysts and exchange operators say China\'s dominance in bitcoin trading is largely due to macro factors like China\'s investment environment, but caution that current volume figures may mask an accurate picture of bitcoin trading flows.Raffael Danielli, an economist who tracks digital currency trading at his Matlab Trading blog, took a macro view of China\'s dominance in the bitcoin markets:""It should not come as a surprise if we see more volume growth coming from Asia than from the West as it would simply reflect the existing disparity in economic growth.""Trading volume dataBitcoin trading volume was dominated by US dollar trading until the end of 2013. USD-BTC trades routinely accounted for more than 70% of traded volume, according to data from Bitcoinity.Last October, dollar dominance began to slip, while yuan-bitcoin trades shot up. This came after the news that the US government had shut down the Silk Road black market, and as 2013 came to a close, CNY and USD trading took turns as market leaders.By March, however, yuan trades began a decisive climb away from dollar trades, breaking the 70% mark of trading volume. Dollar trades plunged to under 25%, and the end of June saw the widest spread in the share of trading volume between yuan and dollar trades: the Chinese currency accounted for 79% of trades, while greenbacks comprised just 16% of the share.Weekly trading volume data from Bitcoinity was used to look at trading volume trends and features over the last two years. Bitcoinity data was chosen because the three top Chinese exchanges were represented, along with the major exchanges outside China.Kacper Cieśla, who runs Bitcoinity, says the data on his site is all self-reported by each exchange. There is a gap in OKCoin data for Nov 2013 to May 2014, which Cieśla attributes to a technical issue at the exchange (OKCoin confirmed that there was a halt in data collection by Bitcoinity for the period).Macro factors and data accuracyOKCoin\'s chief technology officer Changpeng Zhao echoed the macro theme brought up by Danielli, and noted that the range of assets available for retail investors in China is relatively limited, with tight controls on real estate, for example:""There is not much else one can invest in. This, combined with the increase in buying power – people naturally look to bitcoins.""Arthur Hayes, who runs cryptocurrency derivatives exchange BitMEX in Hong Kong, agreed that Chinese trading volumes should outpace trading in the rest of the world, given the Chinese economy\'s growth.Hayes cited China\'s larger population, restricted investment environment and more Internet-friendly banking system as specific reasons for greater bitcoin trading in that country, but he cautioned that the trading volume data may overstate China\'s dominance, because it\'s self-reported.""China definitely is number one, but quantifying its lead is debatable. But I don\'t doubt that China trades more bitcoin than any nation globally,"" he said.Questions about the veracity of self-reported exchange volume data have dogged Chinese exchanges in the past. OKCoin\'s Zhao insisted that his exchange provided accurate data. BTC China founder Bobby Lee didn\'t respond to a request for comment.Huobi\'s chief executive, Leon Li, suggested instead that users place a 100 BTC market-sell order on various exchanges to confirm market depth themselves – a suggestion that was also offered by BitMEX\'s Hayes.""That is an empirical method, which provides more useful information than self-reported exchange transaction volume,"" Li said.Huobi and OKCoin now in the leadAs the share of yuan trading has grown, the amount of trades handled by Chinese exchanges has increased with it. The yuan share spiked last October, closely tracked by an increase in trading volume on BTC China. That exchange briefly held the largest share of trades, accounting for 48% of trades at its peak, from last October to December.By contrast, the amount of trading activity on large exchanges outside China, like Bitstamp and BTC-e, has declined steadily since last autumn. Total trading volume has increased at a steady rate this year, after a growth spurt around the end of last October.BTC China then lost its pole position to Huobi, which overtook the share of trades in mid December and continued to rocket to 67% of trades by January.Huobi was surpassed by OKCoin this year, and Bitcoinity data shows that OKCoin emerged as the trading volume leader in late May.OKCoin\'s own trading data shows that it completed trades worth just over 1m BTC in the last week of March, while Bitcoinity data shows Huobi trading volume for the corresponding period was 729,686 BTC.Today, OKCoin trades take up about 30% of volume while Huobi accounts for around 20%. BTC China, however is climbing quickly, adding 10 basis points over September to take 18% of the volume pie.Zero fees and wash tradesWhile macro factors may account for China\'s lead in bitcoin trading, specific details like fee structures on Chinese exchanges give a further boost to the amount of trades on Chinese exchanges.Danielli pointed to OKCoin\'s margin-trading structure as one reason trading volumes have grown on that exchange. As users trade more, they accumulate \'reward points\' that allow them to borrow more yuan for margin trading. CNY-BTC trading is free on OKCoin and Huobi.""People are \'trading with themselves\' to increase volume and get to [the desired points level],"" Danielli said.The sort of trading described by Danielli is illegal in US equities and commodities markets, where it\'s known as \'wash trading\'. In these transactions, a security doesn\'t technically change hands, and is effectively being traded by one party who takes both sides of the deal.Such trades are outlawed because they distort market information about a security and can mislead other investors, according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Hayes, formerly an equity derivatives trader at Citi, said the zero-fees structure used by Chinese exchanges means that the chances of wash trading on those platforms are high:""Wash trading is a very big deal in traditional finance, but in bitcoin-land, I could just say I traded $1tn in bitcoin derivatives yesterday, but if you\'re stupid enough to believe me, then go ahead.""Tim Swanson, who has written books on business in China and works for Hong Kong-based altcoin exchange Melotic, pointed out that even with possibly-inflated yuan trading volumes, dollar trades may actually be far greater, but aren\'t represented in the data because they\'re traded over-the-counter.Swanson noted that miners and US-based \'universal\' bitcoin firms like BitPay or Coinbase could be processing thousands of coins daily with counterparties with large fiat and bitcoin holdings, but are never traded on an exchange.""The OTC and off-chain liquidity inventory is not being factored into most of the overall discussion on trade volume. The aggregate volumes of OTC or \'dark inventory\' numbers may actually be larger in US dollars than [yuan],"" he said.Impact on wider bitcoin economyEven if trading volume on Chinese exchanges is inflated by wash trades, it\'s unclear how the exchanges stand to gain from occupying the top spot in global trading volumes, since they don\'t earn any revenue from the activity.Swanson thinks pumped up trading volumes could simply be used to build a user-base that would then pay for revenue-generating products. Huobi, for example, has launched a fixed-term certificate of deposit that requires a minimum deposit of 1 BTC.""[Chinese exchanges] are busily trying to answer that question with a variety of value-added services like margin trading and issuing derivative products as well as integrating with API services,"" he said.China maintains strict controls on foreign exchange, although the government is said to be loosening these restrictions gradually. Current rules mean companies and individuals can only move small amounts of funds in and out of the country.For Hayes, China\'s currency controls and the large amount of genuine trading taking place mean the bitcoin markets are divided into those that can tap Chinese markets and those that can\'t.Institutional investors in financial centres like New York or London already face regulatory obstacles to accessing Chinese equity markets, for example. As a result, Chinese markets are walled off, and their dominance may have little impact on traders outside the country.Hayes said:""China might have 70% of the volume, but institutional investors will not trade Bitcoin onshore in China [...] The market is bifurcated. As a non-Chinese person, you can\'t interact with the Chinese banking system. Yuan is still a restricted currency. It means a global investment firm has to trade bitcoin-dollar, because they\'re in New York or London.""Update (28th Sept, 10:10 GMT): An earlier version of this article stated that Huobi CEO Leon Li had declined to comment on the veracity of his exchange\'s volume data. Li had actually stated it was competitors\' data he did not wish to comment on, and he stood by his own company\'s statistics.Yuan and dollar image via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Until then, we’re having fund counting firsts, and today, we’re learning that there’s now a bitcoin ATM in Belgium.Located in the Flemish region of the country in the city of Ghent, the ATM is installed at the Gameswap HQ store — and if you haven’t already guessed by the name, the store sells video games.Filip Roose of Orillia — a bitcoin services company in the country — says the idea behind the ATM is to bring bitcoin out from obscurity.[blockquote style=”2″]To bring it out of the obscure world, we’re trying something here with a machine so you can actually see and touch it, and it’s in the shop. Imagine that something goes wrong, all our contact details are here, so you can always get in touch the people that are behind the system.[/blockquote]The machine, rather simple looking, does as one would expect. Cash is inserted, and the user is prompted to scan his/her mobile device to specify which wallet address the bitcoins should be deposited into. From there, the transaction is completed.Bitcoin ATMs have seemingly taken over the cryptocurrency world by storm over the past year, as users seek easier and more convenient ways to get their hands on the digital currency.That convenience comes at a price, however. ATM operators make money by charging fees on each transaction, would could turn out to be a costly affair for the end user.For more information on the launch of this particular bitcoin ATM, a video has been posted here. Hat tip to CryptoArticles.', 'Early this month, Verizon, one of America\'s largest mobile operators, quietly unveiled a new service called Auto Share. Slated to launch by the end of the year, Auto Share makes it trivially easy to book and unlock a rented car with a smartphone: just scan and validate a QR code on the windshield.Potential implications are, indeed, far-reaching: now any aspiring startup can rely on Verizon\'s infrastructure of ubiquitous connectivity and geolocational tracking to match supply and demand, with Verizon itself providing lucrative verification and locking services. Verizon hopes to eventually extend this model far beyond cars, making it possible to swap any other items fitted with an electronic lock: power drills, laptops, apartments. Verizon – hardly a Silicon Valley pioneer – thus joins many other champions of the ""sharing economy"" in insisting that ""people today are embracing a sharing society – the one that allows them to get what they want on demand"". Gone are the burdens of ownership!For all the incessant talk about disruption and disintermediation, services like Auto Share reveal that digitisation is propelled by a new set of powerful intermediaries that will be much harder to disrupt. Take Facebook: it provides many of the services grouped under the sharing economy with the kind of reliable identity infrastructure that allows us to verify that we are who we say we are when, for example, we book apartments via Airbnb. Facebook provides a free service to Airbnb – call it ""identity on demand"" – and Verizon wants to dominate another such service: ""access on demand"".The smartphone, with its clever sensors and always-on, reliable connectivity, joins all these layers together. A company like Uber, for example, would be unthinkable without the smartphone and its real-time sensors, always ready to pinpoint the car\'s location on the virtual map. The appearance of clever apps such as Auto Share suggests that, instead of retrofitting every object with a sensor as proponents of the Internet of Things advocate, one can latch a QR code on them and let one centralised device – the smartphone – do all the sensing. It\'s not clear which of the two visions – the Internet of Smart Things or the Internet of Dumb Things Connected via Smart Phones – would dominate. Given Apple\'s recent foray into mobile payments, it seems wise to bet on the latter.The very name Auto Share has an intriguing double meaning: it refers not only to the ease with which we can ""share"" automobiles but also to the fact that much of that sharing can be automated. Today, our most beloved belongings can re-enter market circulation without much effort on our part. We no longer need to visit the proverbial bazaar: the market will find us in the comfort of our homes, making us an offer we cannot refuse. The rapid ascent of the sharing economy can thus be explained by capitalism\'s newly found technological capability to convert every commodity that has been bought and removed from the market – temporarily becoming ""dead capital"" of sorts – into a rentable object that never leaves the market at all.At its worst, the sharing economy turns us into perpetual hustlers, cementing our connection to the global market. This sharing imperative dictates that everything that we own, from tangible assets to intangible thoughts, be categorised and assigned some kind of a unique identifier like the QR code. When somebody somewhere – it could be our neighbour or an advertising company across the ocean – expresses an interest in ""borrowing"" an item that matches the description of what we own, our phone would notify us of their offer, pitting us against all the other ""micro-entrepreneurs"" with similar ownership profiles. Once we accept, the rest is logistics: a drone or a self-driving car would stop by to fetch the item – the transport of emotions and thoughts is even easier – and the payment would safely arrive on our smartphones.To some, this is a very appealing proposition: not only does it help to deal with overconsumption – we can all get by with less if we only find a way to use existing resources more efficiently! – but it also gives those on the receiving end of the ""sharing economy"" an exhilarating sense of permanent youth. We can finally break, once and for all, with the usual traps of the boring middle-class existence: no need to settle down, own a house, buy a car, fill the basement with clunky household appliances. It\'s all there, in the cloud, to be rented and delivered by drones.That so many people find this attractive is hardly a surprise: the cheerleaders of the sharing economy have amazing storytelling skills. Their talent for spin rivals that of Steve Jobs. For example, the chief sharing ideologue of Airbnb is Douglas Atkin, also the author of The Culting of Brands, a 2004 bestselling book that coaches executives on how to strengthen their brands by learning from religious cults. The sharing lobby also has its own advocacy group. Called Peers.org, it presents itself as a bottom-up grassroots entity – never mind that it was launched with the corporate blessing of Airbnb, Lyft (a site that helps users ride along on journeys), and TaskRabbit (which finds helpers for jobs and errands). Silicon Valley never gets around to disrupting the lobbyists.But the broader problem with these optimistic, utopian tales is that they rationalise the pathologies of the current political and economic system, presenting them as our conscious lifestyle choices. It\'s nice to be in a position to choose between renting and owning but this is a choice that many people simply do not get to make, settling on ""renting"" as a default option.Airbnb offers stays in this Oregon treehouse – a glimpse, for many, of an unattainable good life.Given vast youth unemployment, stagnating incomes, and skyrocketing property prices, today\'s sharing economy functions as something of a magic wand. Those who already own something can survive by monetising their discomfort: for example, they can earn cash by occasionally renting out their apartments and staying with relatives instead. Those who own nothing, on the other hand, also get to occasionally enjoy a glimpse of the good life – built entirely on goods they do not own.The supposed environmental benefits of the sharing economy are likewise laughable: while we are asked to share our cars with neighbours – it\'s cheaper and greener! – the rich keep enjoying their yachts, limos and private jets, all while the real polluters – oil companies and other industrial giants – get away with even worse offences.There\'s no denying that the sharing economy can – and probably does – make the consequences of the current financial crisis more bearable. However, in tackling the consequences, it does nothing to address the causes. It\'s true that, thanks to advances in the information technology, some of us can finally get by with less – chiefly, by relying on more effective distribution of existing resources. But there\'s nothing to celebrate here: it\'s like handing everybody earplugs to deal with intolerable street noise instead of doing something about the noise itself.Sensors, smartphones, apps: these are our generation\'s earplugs. That we no longer notice how thoroughly they banish anything that even smacks of politics from our lives is itself a telling sign: deafness – to injustice and inequality but, above all, to our own dire state of affairs – is the price we\'ll pay for this dose of immediate comfort.']","['China\'s position as the most active bitcoin trading market has come to attention again as Beijing exchange OKCoin topped daily dollar trades for the first time earlier this week. This comes weeks after Shanghai exchange BTC China highlighted that yuan trades comprised more than 70% of trading volume.As Chinese exchanges jostle for the top spot in global trading volumes, yuan trading is now three times greater than dollar trades. Analysts and exchange operators say China\'s dominance in bitcoin trading is largely due to macro factors like China\'s investment environment, but caution that current volume figures may mask an accurate picture of bitcoin trading flows.Raffael Danielli, an economist who tracks digital currency trading at his Matlab Trading blog, took a macro view of China\'s dominance in the bitcoin markets:""It should not come as a surprise if we see more volume growth coming from Asia than from the West as it would simply reflect the existing disparity in economic growth.""Trading volume dataBitcoin trading volume was dominated by US dollar trading until the end of 2013. USD-BTC trades routinely accounted for more than 70% of traded volume, according to data from Bitcoinity.Last October, dollar dominance began to slip, while yuan-bitcoin trades shot up. This came after the news that the US government had shut down the Silk Road black market, and as 2013 came to a close, CNY and USD trading took turns as market leaders.By March, however, yuan trades began a decisive climb away from dollar trades, breaking the 70% mark of trading volume. Dollar trades plunged to under 25%, and the end of June saw the widest spread in the share of trading volume between yuan and dollar trades: the Chinese currency accounted for 79% of trades, while greenbacks comprised just 16% of the share.Weekly trading volume data from Bitcoinity was used to look at trading volume trends and features over the last two years. Bitcoinity data was chosen because the three top Chinese exchanges were represented, along with the major exchanges outside China.Kacper Cieśla, who runs Bitcoinity, says the data on his site is all self-reported by each exchange. There is a gap in OKCoin data for Nov 2013 to May 2014, which Cieśla attributes to a technical issue at the exchange (OKCoin confirmed that there was a halt in data collection by Bitcoinity for the period).Macro factors and data accuracyOKCoin\'s chief technology officer Changpeng Zhao echoed the macro theme brought up by Danielli, and noted that the range of assets available for retail investors in China is relatively limited, with tight controls on real estate, for example:""There is not much else one can invest in. This, combined with the increase in buying power – people naturally look to bitcoins.""Arthur Hayes, who runs cryptocurrency derivatives exchange BitMEX in Hong Kong, agreed that Chinese trading volumes should outpace trading in the rest of the world, given the Chinese economy\'s growth.Hayes cited China\'s larger population, restricted investment environment and more Internet-friendly banking system as specific reasons for greater bitcoin trading in that country, but he cautioned that the trading volume data may overstate China\'s dominance, because it\'s self-reported.""China definitely is number one, but quantifying its lead is debatable. But I don\'t doubt that China trades more bitcoin than any nation globally,"" he said.Questions about the veracity of self-reported exchange volume data have dogged Chinese exchanges in the past. OKCoin\'s Zhao insisted that his exchange provided accurate data. BTC China founder Bobby Lee didn\'t respond to a request for comment.Huobi\'s chief executive, Leon Li, suggested instead that users place a 100 BTC market-sell order on various exchanges to confirm market depth themselves – a suggestion that was also offered by BitMEX\'s Hayes.""That is an empirical method, which provides more useful information than self-reported exchange transaction volume,"" Li said.Huobi and OKCoin now in the leadAs the share of yuan trading has grown, the amount of trades handled by Chinese exchanges has increased with it. The yuan share spiked last October, closely tracked by an increase in trading volume on BTC China. That exchange briefly held the largest share of trades, accounting for 48% of trades at its peak, from last October to December.By contrast, the amount of trading activity on large exchanges outside China, like Bitstamp and BTC-e, has declined steadily since last autumn. Total trading volume has increased at a steady rate this year, after a growth spurt around the end of last October.BTC China then lost its pole position to Huobi, which overtook the share of trades in mid December and continued to rocket to 67% of trades by January.Huobi was surpassed by OKCoin this year, and Bitcoinity data shows that OKCoin emerged as the trading volume leader in late May.OKCoin\'s own trading data shows that it completed trades worth just over 1m BTC in the last week of March, while Bitcoinity data shows Huobi trading volume for the corresponding period was 729,686 BTC.Today, OKCoin trades take up about 30% of volume while Huobi accounts for around 20%. BTC China, however is climbing quickly, adding 10 basis points over September to take 18% of the volume pie.Zero fees and wash tradesWhile macro factors may account for China\'s lead in bitcoin trading, specific details like fee structures on Chinese exchanges give a further boost to the amount of trades on Chinese exchanges.Danielli pointed to OKCoin\'s margin-trading structure as one reason trading volumes have grown on that exchange. As users trade more, they accumulate \'reward points\' that allow them to borrow more yuan for margin trading. CNY-BTC trading is free on OKCoin and Huobi.""People are \'trading with themselves\' to increase volume and get to [the desired points level],"" Danielli said.The sort of trading described by Danielli is illegal in US equities and commodities markets, where it\'s known as \'wash trading\'. In these transactions, a security doesn\'t technically change hands, and is effectively being traded by one party who takes both sides of the deal.Such trades are outlawed because they distort market information about a security and can mislead other investors, according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Hayes, formerly an equity derivatives trader at Citi, said the zero-fees structure used by Chinese exchanges means that the chances of wash trading on those platforms are high:""Wash trading is a very big deal in traditional finance, but in bitcoin-land, I could just say I traded $1tn in bitcoin derivatives yesterday, but if you\'re stupid enough to believe me, then go ahead.""Tim Swanson, who has written books on business in China and works for Hong Kong-based altcoin exchange Melotic, pointed out that even with possibly-inflated yuan trading volumes, dollar trades may actually be far greater, but aren\'t represented in the data because they\'re traded over-the-counter.Swanson noted that miners and US-based \'universal\' bitcoin firms like BitPay or Coinbase could be processing thousands of coins daily with counterparties with large fiat and bitcoin holdings, but are never traded on an exchange.""The OTC and off-chain liquidity inventory is not being factored into most of the overall discussion on trade volume. The aggregate volumes of OTC or \'dark inventory\' numbers may actually be larger in US dollars than [yuan],"" he said.Impact on wider bitcoin economyEven if trading volume on Chinese exchanges is inflated by wash trades, it\'s unclear how the exchanges stand to gain from occupying the top spot in global trading volumes, since they don\'t earn any revenue from the activity.Swanson thinks pumped up trading volumes could simply be used to build a user-base that would then pay for revenue-generating products. Huobi, for example, has launched a fixed-term certificate of deposit that requires a minimum deposit of 1 BTC.""[Chinese exchanges] are busily trying to answer that question with a variety of value-added services like margin trading and issuing derivative products as well as integrating with API services,"" he said.China maintains strict controls on foreign exchange, although the government is said to be loosening these restrictions gradually. Current rules mean companies and individuals can only move small amounts of funds in and out of the country.For Hayes, China\'s currency controls and the large amount of genuine trading taking place mean the bitcoin markets are divided into those that can tap Chinese markets and those that can\'t.Institutional investors in financial centres like New York or London already face regulatory obstacles to accessing Chinese equity markets, for example. As a result, Chinese markets are walled off, and their dominance may have little impact on traders outside the country.Hayes said:""China might have 70% of the volume, but institutional investors will not trade Bitcoin onshore in China [...] The market is bifurcated. As a non-Chinese person, you can\'t interact with the Chinese banking system. Yuan is still a restricted currency. It means a global investment firm has to trade bitcoin-dollar, because they\'re in New York or London.""Update (28th Sept, 10:10 GMT): An earlier version of this article stated that Huobi CEO Leon Li had declined to comment on the veracity of his exchange\'s volume data. Li had actually stated it was competitors\' data he did not wish to comment on, and he stood by his own company\'s statistics.Yuan and dollar image via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Until then, we’re having fund counting firsts, and today, we’re learning that there’s now a bitcoin ATM in Belgium.Located in the Flemish region of the country in the city of Ghent, the ATM is installed at the Gameswap HQ store — and if you haven’t already guessed by the name, the store sells video games.Filip Roose of Orillia — a bitcoin services company in the country — says the idea behind the ATM is to bring bitcoin out from obscurity.[blockquote style=”2″]To bring it out of the obscure world, we’re trying something here with a machine so you can actually see and touch it, and it’s in the shop. Imagine that something goes wrong, all our contact details are here, so you can always get in touch the people that are behind the system.[/blockquote]The machine, rather simple looking, does as one would expect. Cash is inserted, and the user is prompted to scan his/her mobile device to specify which wallet address the bitcoins should be deposited into. From there, the transaction is completed.Bitcoin ATMs have seemingly taken over the cryptocurrency world by storm over the past year, as users seek easier and more convenient ways to get their hands on the digital currency.That convenience comes at a price, however. ATM operators make money by charging fees on each transaction, would could turn out to be a costly affair for the end user.For more information on the launch of this particular bitcoin ATM, a video has been posted here. Hat tip to CryptoArticles.', 'Early this month, Verizon, one of America\'s largest mobile operators, quietly unveiled a new service called Auto Share. Slated to launch by the end of the year, Auto Share makes it trivially easy to book and unlock a rented car with a smartphone: just scan and validate a QR code on the windshield.Potential implications are, indeed, far-reaching: now any aspiring startup can rely on Verizon\'s infrastructure of ubiquitous connectivity and geolocational tracking to match supply and demand, with Verizon itself providing lucrative verification and locking services. Verizon hopes to eventually extend this model far beyond cars, making it possible to swap any other items fitted with an electronic lock: power drills, laptops, apartments. Verizon – hardly a Silicon Valley pioneer – thus joins many other champions of the ""sharing economy"" in insisting that ""people today are embracing a sharing society – the one that allows them to get what they want on demand"". Gone are the burdens of ownership!For all the incessant talk about disruption and disintermediation, services like Auto Share reveal that digitisation is propelled by a new set of powerful intermediaries that will be much harder to disrupt. Take Facebook: it provides many of the services grouped under the sharing economy with the kind of reliable identity infrastructure that allows us to verify that we are who we say we are when, for example, we book apartments via Airbnb. Facebook provides a free service to Airbnb – call it ""identity on demand"" – and Verizon wants to dominate another such service: ""access on demand"".The smartphone, with its clever sensors and always-on, reliable connectivity, joins all these layers together.

10/11/2014,"['Pakistani bitcoin exchange Urdubit launched today in an effort to facilitate greater adoption of the digital currency in the region.The launch aims to usher Pakistan into the wider bitcoin community, as its operators are bullish on the digital currency’s potential as a solution to greater geopolitical issues in the area.For now, Urdubit is focused on bringing liquidity to local bitcoin trading markets and educating newcomers on its promise as a decentralized commodity. Its founding partners, Zain Tariq and Danyal Manzar, are the founder and chief operating officer, respectively, of bitcoin community and advocacy group BitcoinPk.Manzar told CoinDesk:“When we started out educating people about the block chain and how it can be used as a payment gateway, we found many people mining bitcoins who did not have any medium to trade them directly into Pakistani rupees.”Urdubit uses the BlinkTrade open-source software and technology, which offers operators a cost-effective way to open bitcoin exchanges without having to hire a developer.This is BlinkTrade’s third client. It also powers digital currency exchanges in Paraguay and Venezuela.Instant depositsThe cloud-based, decentralized nature of the BlinkTrade software enables exchange operators to bring bitcoin liquidity to regions with less active bitcoin trading markets.Unlike other exchanges, Urdubit offers Instant Deposits technology, which allows users to access their traded bitcoin immediately without having to wait for confirmations.BlinkTrade head Rodrigo Souza said to CoinDesk:“Most of the traders leave their bitcoins at exchanges because they don\'t want to wait for three to six confirmations to trade, and this creates a pot of gold that attracts hackers. It is not good for the exchange operators and not good for the system.”To do this, verified Urdubit users first need to confirm their bitcoin addresses. Once validated, the next transaction from that address will credit the bitcoin into the trader’s account, so it is available for him or her to use instantly, with zero confirmation. This way, Souza explained, the trader doesn\'t have to leave his or her bitcoin sitting statically in any exchange.Users are unable to withdraw any bitcoins or fiat while a deposit is unconfirmed, in a measure to prevent double spending. In the case of a double spending attack, Souza explained, the trader would lose access to his funds, and the exchange operators will get access to all his account data.Urdubit charges a 0.75% fee on all trades, and 1% on deposits and withdrawals in Pakistani rupees. Bitcoin deposits are free; there is a 0.0001 BTC miner\'s fee on withdrawals.‘Money in the new world’Doing business in Pakistan is heavily influenced by Islamic guidelines, Tariq told CoinDesk; people there are generally motivated by peace but challenged by education.About 96% of Pakistanis are Muslim. An estimated 21% of the population lives below the poverty line, and the country has a total adult literacy rate of 55%.“We plan to create a platform where people feel safe with the world of bitcoin and hopefully substitute it for trading locally as easily as Pakistani rupees, while giving everyone an opportunity to invest in this commodity,” Tariq said.Michael Sweeney is founder, secretary and treasurer of the Women\'s Annex Foundation (WAF), a platform that encourages young women to exercise their intellectual freedom through blog-writing and social media and pays them in bitcoin to do so. While most of its operations are based across Afghanistan, it also has a presence in Mexico, Egypt and Pakistan.Speaking to CoinDesk ahead of the Urdubit launch, Sweeney said the people that WAF has seen use and accept bitcoin in Pakistan are “very entrepreneurial”, and that although there aren’t any bitcoin exchanges in the region he was aware of at the time of the interview, he’s observed that users find ways to use the digital currency through gift or phone cards.He told CoinDesk:“It has changed my perception of ‘money’.

A number of companies in the space including China-based manufacturer Bitmain, cooling technology specialist Green Revolution Cooling and more were also in attendance.Many in the 100-strong crowd were small- or medium-sized bitcoin and altcoin miners, most of whom have been mining for at least the past year-and-a-half. As some told CoinDesk, the event provided an avenue for miners to both interface with companies in the space and learn new ideas to apply to their existing strategies.Opening talk on crypto’s futureThe first panel, which included Draper, Garza and Terpin, cast a wide net by asking a simple question: where is crypto headed today?Though focused primarily on the technological advancements made possible using digital currency, the panel members – as well as many others on the first day of the event – found their way back to one of the industry’s hottest topics: the price of bitcoin.Draper noted that he may have been “too conservative” about his prediction of $10,000 per bitcoin in three years. He remarked that miners who exchange their bitcoins for fiat currencies are a significant part of the selling pressure we’re seeing on the markets today.Draper explained that this dynamic should reverse in the future, saying:“[Miners are] a force-selling component and nobody’s buying. But as these companies evolve and all of these businesses allow us to use bitcoin for more and more purposes, that will be what drives the price up.”Terpin polled the crowd by asking how many sell a certain percentage of their bitcoins for fiat currencies like the dollar. One only miner raised their hand when Terpin asked if they sold 100% of their bitcoin for dollars, and about one-third of the crowd indicated that they don’t sell any of their generated bitcoins.Garza voiced the least concern regarding the price, saying that ultimately, the value of bitcoin is underpinned not so much by the consumers and merchants who use and accept digital currency but by the miners who facilitate the whole network.“Miners believe in the currency the most,” he said.Garza later drew applause when he said that GAWMiners pushes strongly for acceptance within its business-to-business dealings, saying that his company has told others that “if you won’t accept our bitcoins we won’t do business with you.”The panel also discussed how the future of digital currency usage will see a rapid increase in the development and deployment of smart contracts. Draper said that he is currently exploring options for use in his venture capital dealings, adding that the legal and accounting professions risk being upended by smart contracts or programmable transactions.Terpin argued during the panel that, as far as the US is concerned, the move toward digital currency adoption won’t be as smooth as Draper was predicting. The problem, he said, was that American bitcoin users haven’t been presented with a viable use case for the technology.“I don’t think there’s a killer app in the US beyond investing if you have a bank account,” Terpin concluded.The panel also spoke briefly on the topic of the underbanked and bitcoin in emerging markets. All three participants touched on the potential of bitcoin-powered remittances, but acknowledged how the infrastructure isn’t quite yet in place for emerging market use of bitcoin to take off.“The question is: how do you get bitcoin to all these people?” Draper asked.Industry dives deepFollowing the broad opening panel, the first day of Hasher’s United featured a plethora of talks and discussions on some of the issues facing miners today, potential revenue sources and strategies for maximizing efficiency and profits.There were also a series of presentations made by companies in the space, including one by Genesis Mining which saw the unveiling of Project X, a new product that enables cross-coin mining without the need to purchase separate contracts. Several altcoin developers, including litecoin creator Charlie Lee and the teams behind ultracoin and unbreakablecoin also held demos and exhibitions during the event.Lifeboat Foundation advisor and CoinDesk contributor Hass McCook led a talk on the business foundations of bitcoin, breaking the digital currency mining and services sectors down to their basic structural elements. He argued that some miners do themselves a disservice by not adopting more formal business practices, a problem that, in some ways, holds back the broader industry.He explained that the market fundamentals remain solid, providing a unique opportunity for miners to create value-added services based on the creative demands of their customer base.McCook added:“There are so many things that bitcoin can do for us, we don’t know 90% of what it can do for us yet. These [use cases] will come out as smart people continue developing products.”Predicting that “95% of bitcoin startups will fail,"" McCook offered his vision for the future crypto-economy. He predicted that, owing to the homogenous nature of bitcoin hardware and the general trends we’re seeing in the industry today, the digital currency market ten years from now will be characterized by greater consolidation, the creation of so-called “super-services” and the proliferation of block chain technology in a number of key industries.He acknowledged that the process won’t be simple, and that further price discovery will likely occur. On the other hand, McCook said that events such as the notorious \'bearwhale\' may become less frequent as usage ignites and major players hold less bitcoins overall.Mining’s behavioral challengesOne of the more notable panels of the day centered on the topic of game theory and the question of how this area of research can be applied to bitcoin mining and the wide-ranging security vulnerabilities facing the sector today.The talk included insights from Cornell University researcher Emin Gun Sirer, Princeton University assistant professor Arvind Narayanan, University of Maryland PhD candidate Andrew Miller and Sean Bowe, creator of model development platform SimBit.Miller, who shared his research on the types of attacks centered on bitcoin mining pools, including so-called vigilante attacks that essentially sabotage the act of collective mining.He offered a series of potential changes to the reward structure, including changing the dynamic nature of block rewards to encourage less malevolence. At the same time, Miller suggested that the consensus-base nature of bitcoin development and the technology’s history could prevent otherwise worthwhile fixes from being integrated:“Any time there will be a consideration in the future of a possible change, there will be some kind of complicated tug-of-war over the tradeoffs and the prior investments that might be affected by it.”Sirer, co-author of a controversial paper on a mining network vulnerability known as selfish mining, opined that the mining sector itself isn’t the simplest ecosystem to map out and analyse from theoretical and behavioral perspectives.“It’s difficult to model what miners want,” he offered.Narayanan argued that game theorists who work in the bitcoin space need to do a better job of interfacing with other parts of the ecosystem in order to obtain more reliable data.He said:“What I think is that the theorists and academics working on bitcoin need to work out to the community, the miners, and have a firm grasp of some of these strategies’ implications in order to input into the game theory models.”Sirer disputed this, offering examples of how his team reached out to both community members and the bitcoin core development team. Bluntly acknowledging the “pushback” he experienced following the release of the selfish mining paper, Sirer thanked the core team for being open to the eventual development of a fix to the vulnerability.During a question-and-answer session after the panel, one miner asked about the risk of 51% attacks on the network given the rise of large mining pools in the past. The participants stated that, ultimately, there is little to do in a distributed system like bitcoin mining beyond community outreach to keep mining conglomerates honest.“There is nothing to push it back except social pressure,” Sirer concluded.A full recording of the first day of Hasher\'s United can be found below:Images via The Tuscany Hotel & Casino, GAWMiner, ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He has also recently launched a consumer-friendly bitcoin and dogecoin buying service called Celery.Since the advent of electronic payments, there has been a clear shift away from cash and checks. Credit and debit cards, and more recently prepaid debit cards, have been a staple of many consumers’ daily lives.With the announcement of Apple Pay, Apple is betting that consumers want an even more convenient way to pay in person. Many in the payment space have attempted to make this evolutionary leap, but it seems that with Apple’s dominance of the easy-to-use mobile device market, it is uniquely positioned to become successful. There are existing examples of similar, successful implementations, with consumers in South Korea and Japan having long used mobile phones at the point of sale.Glenbrook Partners, a payments strategy and consulting firm, believes that consumer adoption of new payment mechanisms comes down to two things: significant increases in convenience and/or perceived financial gains.Apple Pay has internalized these two main drivers of consumer adoption and will likely be successful given its relationships with major card networks and banks. Similarly bitcoin, once past the learning curve, has significant conveniences over other payment methods and as the software evolves, will become more so. However, the financial benefits have not yet materialized.Another parallel between Apple Pay and bitcoin is security. Apple Pay employs tokenization of information across the network and so is one of the most secure ways to pay in person, along with cash.Apple Pay is well-positioned to make mobile payments pervasive with 220,000 merchants already signed up, an estimated 5 to 10 percent of the millions of merchant locations in the U.S.It’s important to note, though, that Apple Pay has a dozen partner banks representing 83 percent of credit card spending in the U.S. but makes no mention of debit cards, which are issued by 14,000 merchants. As Generation Y is considered the debit card generation, hopefully Apple can cover that market, as well.How does bitcoin benefit? Bitcoin depends on only one network — the Internet. Consumers are required to use mobile devices to initiate payment. Apple will shift consumer behavior to their devices and will make security a major consideration when consumers choose payment methods, especially after the recent parade of cyber intrusions of banks and merchants.Bitcoin, as a payment network, is unmatched in its global design, affordability and security. Apple Pay is helping to lead the charge, and as bitcoin matures it will benefit from it. Rather than being a threat to bitcoin, as some commentators have rhetorically suggested, Apple Pay should provide digital currency with a boost — it could be the killer app that digital currency has been waiting for.With digital currency, there’s nothing to jangle in your pockets and weigh you down as you walk. You can’t lose digital currency down the back of the couch. There’s no paperwork required and it supports online payments. Other advantages that digital currency has over physical, which may not be so obvious to the casual observer, are the lower transaction fees and the lack of a central issuer – so the user doesn’t have to put their faith in a banking system that may have let them down in the past.According to a 2014 report on the use of cash by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, cash is still king when it comes to retail payments under $25 in the United States. The report states that the fact that debit cards tend to be used frequently for person-to-person transfers and several other categories of expenditure such as gifts, food, transportation and entertainment indicates that cash usage likely is not the result of a lack of access to alternative payment options.The average transaction size for many of these expenditure categories is relatively low, suggesting that the reason cash is the most or second-most frequently used payment instrument is because small value transactions tend to dominate these categories.The conclusion I draw from this is that cash is encouraged by merchants and retailers for small transaction sizes either through minimum transaction sizes or with higher prices by including taxes. Who can blame them? The transaction fees for credit and debit cards erode profits for smaller transactions, 30 cents + 3 percent for each transaction.As bitcoin grows and Apple Pay extends its reach over the next few years, cash will shrink. The governments are incentivized to promote digital currencies because of the visibility they can glean from their public ledgers. Bitcoin analytics startups such as Blocktrail and Coinalytics are receiving funding to help the world understand what’s going on in the payment network, much the same way the traditional banking system has been monitored.Apple Pay and digital currency will play a massive part in changing how consumers perceive — and make — low-value payments. The businesses that are quickest to realize this will be the ones that benefit – but believe me, the days of physical cash are numbered.', 'The HYPER decentralized currency project announced new developments. HYPER is a peer-to-peer digital currency that rewards users who “stake” their wallets by issuing compound interest, with settlement times 20x faster than Bitcoin.The announcement states:“The currency’s multi-stage economic model incentivizes users to keep their wallet clients running on regular desktops and laptops, which is what enables this currency to be so decentralized. Transactions are processed and verified by true peers, not by wealthy mining interests.”HYPER is an alt coin for use in online games, emerging virtual worlds, Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games, simulations and more. It’s designed to be an open source currency catered specifically to the needs of game environments. Players will be able to buy game assets (for example weapons) for HYPER, and be paid for achievements.Tangible Rewards for GamersThe HYPER team plans to add monetary value to leaderboards: besides ego gratification, top scorers will receive real rewards that can be converted to Bitcoin at the Bittrex exchange. They run Counter Strike and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive servers where anyone can join and earn HYPER by defeating other players and bots. Other multiplayer games supported are Zandagort (a cult space MMO strategy game “resurrected” by the team), and a special custom written RPG mod of Minecraft.HYPER announced upcoming game servers for World of Warcraft Arena, Team Fortress 2, and Just Cause 2. They are also developing a new MMO space strategy game in which players will construct an intergalactic empire, and earn HYPER.With team members in North America, Europe, and Asia, HYPER is a truly decentralized currency project anyone anywhere can participate in. They announced that, in the weeks ahead, a number of payment gateways will become available, making it easy for gamers to buy HYPER with USD using any major credit card and PayPal. For the time being, U.S. exchange Bittrex.com is the most popular market for buying or selling HYPER. Soon, U.S. exchanges CoinMKT and AltMarket will also offer HYPER trading on their platforms.The HYPER team runs two separate websites with separate domain names: hyper.cash and hypercrypto.com. Another good source of information is the official HYPER thread on bitcointalk, which is frequently updated, and the HYPER Twitter feed.Images from HYPER project and Valve.Advertisement:', 'Рабочая группа по финансовым стандартам организации Bitcoin Foundation объявила план работы на ближайшие полгода, то есть на IV кв. 2014-го и I кв. 2015 года. Среди предусмотренных мероприятий — регистрация кода валюты Bitcoin в официальном стандарте ISO 4217, а также выработка рекомендаций по официальному знаку Bitcoin.«Стандартизация — важный шаг к устранению препятствий к повсеместному использованию технологии, — сказал Джон Матонис (Jon Matonis), исполнительный директор Bitcoin Foundation. — Это особенно справедливо для финансовой инновационной технологии, которая носит глобальный характер».В качестве кода, возможно, утвердят общепринятый BTC, хотя тут не всё ясно. Для глобальных товаров принято первым символом указывать X, например, XAU (золото). То же самое касается наднациональных валют, например, XEU (предшественник евро).Для знака биткоина определённости ещё меньше. Сообщество продолжает споры, пытаясь выбрать из нескольких вариантов. Наиболее популярных кандидатов три: ฿, Ƀ, B.Рабочая группа выработает и рекомендации по поводу субъединиц биткоина, которые поддерживаются до восьмого знака (0.00000001). Но это не соответствует принятым форматам ($1,00), не поддерживается в стандартном финансовом и бухгалтерском программном обеспечении и вносит путаницу в умы обывателей.Хотя бюрократические преграды ещё существуют, но с технологической точки зрения Bitcoin Core уже готов к обслуживанию миллиардов транзакций. С последними анонсами обновлений в протоколе, а также в связи с нынешней тенденцией по масштабируемости сети и пропускных каналов связи, один из ведущих разработчиков Гэвин Андерсон сказал: «Даже если каждый человек в мире полностью перейдёт с наличных денег на биткоины в течение 20 лет, транслируя все транзакции на каждый полностью проверенный узел в сети Bitcoin, это не станет проблемой».']","['Pakistani bitcoin exchange Urdubit launched today in an effort to facilitate greater adoption of the digital currency in the region.The launch aims to usher Pakistan into the wider bitcoin community, as its operators are bullish on the digital currency’s potential as a solution to greater geopolitical issues in the area.For now, Urdubit is focused on bringing liquidity to local bitcoin trading markets and educating newcomers on its promise as a decentralized commodity. Its founding partners, Zain Tariq and Danyal Manzar, are the founder and chief operating officer, respectively, of bitcoin community and advocacy group BitcoinPk.Manzar told CoinDesk:“When we started out educating people about the block chain and how it can be used as a payment gateway, we found many people mining bitcoins who did not have any medium to trade them directly into Pakistani rupees.”Urdubit uses the BlinkTrade open-source software and technology, which offers operators a cost-effective way to open bitcoin exchanges without having to hire a developer.This is BlinkTrade’s third client. It also powers digital currency exchanges in Paraguay and Venezuela.Instant depositsThe cloud-based, decentralized nature of the BlinkTrade software enables exchange operators to bring bitcoin liquidity to regions with less active bitcoin trading markets.Unlike other exchanges, Urdubit offers Instant Deposits technology, which allows users to access their traded bitcoin immediately without having to wait for confirmations.BlinkTrade head Rodrigo Souza said to CoinDesk:“Most of the traders leave their bitcoins at exchanges because they don\'t want to wait for three to six confirmations to trade, and this creates a pot of gold that attracts hackers. It is not good for the exchange operators and not good for the system.”To do this, verified Urdubit users first need to confirm their bitcoin addresses. Once validated, the next transaction from that address will credit the bitcoin into the trader’s account, so it is available for him or her to use instantly, with zero confirmation. This way, Souza explained, the trader doesn\'t have to leave his or her bitcoin sitting statically in any exchange.Users are unable to withdraw any bitcoins or fiat while a deposit is unconfirmed, in a measure to prevent double spending. In the case of a double spending attack, Souza explained, the trader would lose access to his funds, and the exchange operators will get access to all his account data.Urdubit charges a 0.75% fee on all trades, and 1% on deposits and withdrawals in Pakistani rupees. Bitcoin deposits are free; there is a 0.0001 BTC miner\'s fee on withdrawals.‘Money in the new world’Doing business in Pakistan is heavily influenced by Islamic guidelines, Tariq told CoinDesk; people there are generally motivated by peace but challenged by education.About 96% of Pakistanis are Muslim. An estimated 21% of the population lives below the poverty line, and the country has a total adult literacy rate of 55%.“We plan to create a platform where people feel safe with the world of bitcoin and hopefully substitute it for trading locally as easily as Pakistani rupees, while giving everyone an opportunity to invest in this commodity,” Tariq said.Michael Sweeney is founder, secretary and treasurer of the Women\'s Annex Foundation (WAF), a platform that encourages young women to exercise their intellectual freedom through blog-writing and social media and pays them in bitcoin to do so. While most of its operations are based across Afghanistan, it also has a presence in Mexico, Egypt and Pakistan.Speaking to CoinDesk ahead of the Urdubit launch, Sweeney said the people that WAF has seen use and accept bitcoin in Pakistan are “very entrepreneurial”, and that although there aren’t any bitcoin exchanges in the region he was aware of at the time of the interview, he’s observed that users find ways to use the digital currency through gift or phone cards.He told CoinDesk:“It has changed my perception of ‘money’. Here in the US, we are so used to the USD being our currency. It creates the basis for accounting, finance, day-to-day groceries. Now I see things in terms of ‘value’ and ‘time spent’. How much time did it take me to earn that new mobile phone or how many years did it take for my house to double in value?

Apple Pay employs tokenization of information across the network and so is one of the most secure ways to pay in person, along with cash.Apple Pay is well-positioned to make mobile payments pervasive with 220,000 merchants already signed up, an estimated 5 to 10 percent of the millions of merchant locations in the U.S.It’s important to note, though, that Apple Pay has a dozen partner banks representing 83 percent of credit card spending in the U.S. but makes no mention of debit cards, which are issued by 14,000 merchants. As Generation Y is considered the debit card generation, hopefully Apple can cover that market, as well.How does bitcoin benefit? Bitcoin depends on only one network — the Internet. Consumers are required to use mobile devices to initiate payment. Apple will shift consumer behavior to their devices and will make security a major consideration when consumers choose payment methods, especially after the recent parade of cyber intrusions of banks and merchants.Bitcoin, as a payment network, is unmatched in its global design, affordability and security. Apple Pay is helping to lead the charge, and as bitcoin matures it will benefit from it. Rather than being a threat to bitcoin, as some commentators have rhetorically suggested, Apple Pay should provide digital currency with a boost — it could be the killer app that digital currency has been waiting for.With digital currency, there’s nothing to jangle in your pockets and weigh you down as you walk. You can’t lose digital currency down the back of the couch. There’s no paperwork required and it supports online payments. Other advantages that digital currency has over physical, which may not be so obvious to the casual observer, are the lower transaction fees and the lack of a central issuer – so the user doesn’t have to put their faith in a banking system that may have let them down in the past.According to a 2014 report on the use of cash by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, cash is still king when it comes to retail payments under $25 in the United States. The report states that the fact that debit cards tend to be used frequently for person-to-person transfers and several other categories of expenditure such as gifts, food, transportation and entertainment indicates that cash usage likely is not the result of a lack of access to alternative payment options.The average transaction size for many of these expenditure categories is relatively low, suggesting that the reason cash is the most or second-most frequently used payment instrument is because small value transactions tend to dominate these categories.The conclusion I draw from this is that cash is encouraged by merchants and retailers for small transaction sizes either through minimum transaction sizes or with higher prices by including taxes. Who can blame them? The transaction fees for credit and debit cards erode profits for smaller transactions, 30 cents + 3 percent for each transaction.As bitcoin grows and Apple Pay extends its reach over the next few years, cash will shrink. The governments are incentivized to promote digital currencies because of the visibility they can glean from their public ledgers. Bitcoin analytics startups such as Blocktrail and Coinalytics are receiving funding to help the world understand what’s going on in the payment network, much the same way the traditional banking system has been monitored.Apple Pay and digital currency will play a massive part in changing how consumers perceive — and make — low-value payments. The businesses that are quickest to realize this will be the ones that benefit – but believe me, the days of physical cash are numbered.', 'The HYPER decentralized currency project announced new developments. HYPER is a peer-to-peer digital currency that rewards users who “stake” their wallets by issuing compound interest, with settlement times 20x faster than Bitcoin.The announcement states:“The currency’s multi-stage economic model incentivizes users to keep their wallet clients running on regular desktops and laptops, which is what enables this currency to be so decentralized. Transactions are processed and verified by true peers, not by wealthy mining interests.”HYPER is an alt coin for use in online games, emerging virtual worlds, Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games, simulations and more. It’s designed to be an open source currency catered specifically to the needs of game environments. Players will be able to buy game assets (for example weapons) for HYPER, and be paid for achievements.Tangible Rewards for GamersThe HYPER team plans to add monetary value to leaderboards: besides ego gratification, top scorers will receive real rewards that can be converted to Bitcoin at the Bittrex exchange. They run Counter Strike and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive servers where anyone can join and earn HYPER by defeating other players and bots. Other multiplayer games supported are Zandagort (a cult space MMO strategy game “resurrected” by the team), and a special custom written RPG mod of Minecraft.HYPER announced upcoming game servers for World of Warcraft Arena, Team Fortress 2, and Just Cause 2. They are also developing a new MMO space strategy game in which players will construct an intergalactic empire, and earn HYPER.With team members in North America, Europe, and Asia, HYPER is a truly decentralized currency project anyone anywhere can participate in. They announced that, in the weeks ahead, a number of payment gateways will become available, making it easy for gamers to buy HYPER with USD using any major credit card and PayPal. For the time being, U.S. exchange Bittrex.com is the most popular market for buying or selling HYPER. Soon, U.S. exchanges CoinMKT and AltMarket will also offer HYPER trading on their platforms.The HYPER team runs two separate websites with separate domain names: hyper.cash and hypercrypto.com. Another good source of information is the official HYPER thread on bitcointalk, which is frequently updated, and the HYPER Twitter feed.Images from HYPER project and Valve.Advertisement:', 'Рабочая группа по финансовым стандартам организации Bitcoin Foundation объявила план работы на ближайшие полгода, то есть на IV кв. 2014-го и I кв. 2015 года. Среди предусмотренных мероприятий — регистрация кода валюты Bitcoin в официальном стандарте ISO 4217, а также выработка рекомендаций по официальному знаку Bitcoin.«Стандартизация — важный шаг к устранению препятствий к повсеместному использованию технологии, — сказал Джон Матонис (Jon Matonis), исполнительный директор Bitcoin Foundation. — Это особенно справедливо для финансовой инновационной технологии, которая носит глобальный характер».В качестве кода, возможно, утвердят общепринятый BTC, хотя тут не всё ясно. Для глобальных товаров принято первым символом указывать X, например, XAU (золото). То же самое касается наднациональных валют, например, XEU (предшественник евро).Для знака биткоина определённости ещё меньше. Сообщество продолжает споры, пытаясь выбрать из нескольких вариантов. Наиболее популярных кандидатов три: ฿, Ƀ, B.Рабочая группа выработает и рекомендации по поводу субъединиц биткоина, которые поддерживаются до восьмого знака (0.00000001). Но это не соответствует принятым форматам ($1,00), не поддерживается в стандартном финансовом и бухгалтерском программном обеспечении и вносит путаницу в умы обывателей.Хотя бюрократические преграды ещё существуют, но с технологической точки зрения Bitcoin Core уже готов к обслуживанию миллиардов транзакций. С последними анонсами обновлений в протоколе, а также в связи с нынешней тенденцией по масштабируемости сети и пропускных каналов связи, один из ведущих разработчиков Гэвин Андерсон сказал: «Даже если каждый человек в мире полностью перейдёт с наличных денег на биткоины в течение 20 лет, транслируя все транзакции на каждый полностью проверенный узел в сети Bitcoin, это не станет проблемой».']"

11/15/2014,"[""In recent months, there has been a growing number of instances across the globe of legacy banks withdrawing their services and support for companies dealing in Bitcoin.In Bangladesh, the national bank threatened up to 12 years in a very unpleasant Bangladesh prison for doing business with or even educating people about Bitcoin.In the United Kingdom, just one day before the Crypto Valley Summit, a number of banks pressured the firm that handled Bitcoin accounts into closing any Bitcoin associated accounts. Now it appears that Swedish banks have gotten into the act as well.Gustav Nipe of New Technology Today indicated that the Swedish banking system is extremely resistant to new technologies, despite the many problems that it has been experiencing, such as the policy of a zero percent interest rate, which never came to be at all.The low rate he suggests indicates a very slow growth economy. Banks often raise and lower interest rates to stimulate the economy, but the fact that this might no longer appear to be a tool that is available to Riksbank indicates real trouble. If interest rates are not lowered it could begin to cause a lack of trust in the banks, resulting in less loans being made, which translates into less business expansion.The high interest rates in previous years was one of the reasons why Bitcoin began to catch on in Sweden because it seemed to be inflation proof and its decentralized nature really appealed to Swedes in general.Finally, the fact that there was no real transmission fees, even for very large transactions, made it popular with the business community. A simple internet connection allowed customers to make payments without all the paperwork and fees that usually come with this activity.But now it seems that banks are arbitrarily closing accounts of the dozen or so Bitcoin companies. One bank, Länsförsäkringar, announced that they did not want any customers using Bitcoin and Nordea closed the accounts of Bitcoinbolag. Then, in response to questions about the reason, the bank announced that they have no obligation to provide a reason.Nipe speculated that the reason was a simple fear of competition by the banks from a decentralized currency because Bitcoin can operate outside of the financial system controlled by them:“We need more entrepreneurs who dare and can develop new payment systems, which are stuck in old ways of thinking. Riksbank's statement on introducing a zero interest rate will continue to raise house prices and bring the economy into a new bubble. The winners are those who speculate healthy and sitting on large loans. Small savers with money in the bank are the losers.”Keeping the actions of other banks around the world in mind, Nipe may in fact have a valid point. The fact is that for most people, banks are simply a safe place to store assets. The problem is that this storage can cost many consumers a great deal of those assets overtime and bank failures have been happening with increasing regularity over the past century, especially as governments seek more and more deregulation of the financial industry.Because of the current unpredictability of the banking system, new paradigms such as Bitcoin can serve as a real alternative to their monopolistic system.St. Louis Fed economist David Andolfatto released a presentation on Bitcoin in April of 2014 and he seemed to agree that Bitcoin did in fact present a threat to the central banks, explaining:“I do think its existence as a threat is very good: It will discipline the Fed and other central banks to continue to run responsible policies — if they don’t, people could switch to something else. The idea of currency competition: Many countries impose currency controls. In Albania, you would suffer severe consequences if you were caught with U.S. dollars in your pocket. The purpose of currency controls is to stimulate demand for domestic currency, because the central bank and the central government want to exploit the people by inflating excessively, so the threat of currency competition — if a central bank, a government, knew people could stop using domestic currency and flock to an alternative, that would force the government to behave more responsibly.”But now, we not only see banks refusing and closing accounts, influencing third parties to discriminate, but also threatening users and businesses with prison time such as in the case of Bangladesh. So far none of the larger countries banks have declared open warfare on Bitcoin, but if the last few months is any indication, there may be real trouble on the horizon.Did you enjoy this article? You may also be interested in reading these ones:"", 'In a November 6 interview in Dublin, Ireland, recorded at this year’s Web Summit, Gavin Andresen called Bitcoin “shady.”He was speaking of Bitcoin in the past, and said, “We’re quickly evolving to something that is much more mainstream, much more accepted, much easier to use.” Speaking with the Wall Street Journal’s Lisa Fleisher, he talked about the future — of Bitcoin, mining, money, regulation and the world.“The biggest misconception is still that Bitcoin is some deep, dark, mysterious thing for illicit markets. . . . We’ve evolved past that and we see huge companies like Dell Computer accepting Bitcoin for ordinary products.”On the same day that he made these statements, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation took down Silk Road 2.0 and other dark markets. Probably still in the dark about the events as they occurred, Andresen and Fleisher talked about Andresen’s positive outlook.On mining, he said, “The centralization of mining is going to go in waves. . . Once chips become commodities and they are really inexpensive, you’ll see it decentralize again.” In the future, he said, “maybe your cell phone, when it’s recharging, will generate a couple Bitcoins on the side.”On money, he remarked:“I think we’ll go past physical cash. People becoming afraid of Ebola on their Euro notes might become a real thing...and all it would take would be one story of someone catching some terrible disease by handling cash, and you’ll see people rushing to the exits to find a more hygienic way of transacting money.”On the future: In 20 years, the world will look “mostly like it looks today.” Most everyone will be “carrying around these wonderful little computers where you can pay anybody in the world, immediately, using something like Bitcoin, or some kind of future, accepted, worldwide global currency.”“Right now, the most important issue for Bitcoin businesses is actually interfacing with the fiat money, with the banking systems around the world.” He continued:“Getting regulatory clarity has been really important. Over the last year, year and a half, certainly in the US and Europe, we’ve seen more regulatory clarity. We’ve seen organizations like the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN) in the US come out with guidance on — if you were doing these certain things with Bitcoin — [they said,] ‘Here are the hoops you need to jump through. Here’s how we’re going to regulate you.’ And I think that’s been really positive for Bitcoin.”Andresen has been heavily involved in Bitcoin since the early days. Only Satoshi Nakamoto has been more so. After discovering Bitcoin in 2010, Andresen worked to help Nakamoto make tweaks and improvements to the software code.Why would a man once given Satoshi’s blessing to manage the Bitcoin project, who earned almost US$210,000 from his work with the Bitcoin Foundation in 2013, call the source of so much benefit to him since 2010 “shady”? The early days of the protocol were the time when he himself was most attracted to it.He expressed more sympathy in the interview for the plight of government regulators than for that of Bitcoin:“Regulators have a hard job. [They] have to react to this new technology and try to fit it into laws that were passed 40, 50, 100 years ago. It really is a struggle with them and you see that in all areas of technology. Since money and banking are probably one of the most heavily regulated sectors, it’s particularly challenging for Bitcoin.”By the last sentence, he means that Bitcoin is more of challenge for regulators, rather than regulators being a challenge for Bitcoin. Never mind that regulators create the laws that make things challenging, and they choose to be a part of the system that enforces century-old laws. They could just as easily choose to “uncreate” old laws, and go find jobs that support innovation, rather than corralling the world under the guise of security and preventing it from moving forward.People like Andresen might then be able to imagine a world that could look significantly different in two decades, rather than “basically the same as today.”First he cleaned up the Bitcoin source code. Then he cleans up the “shadiness” of Bitcoin by supporting “incredibly positive” government regulation. Who masquerades as the Bitcoin redeemer, the government or Andresen?For Bitcoin experts and supporters working in a spotlight, it’s a tough place to be. “Going forward,” he said, “the challenge will be to not get over-regulation that stifles innovation.”Did you enjoy this article?

The member states are granted considerable discretion as to how they will achieve these goals (see Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). “EU Regulations,” in contrast, specify both the goals and the means by which States must achieve them.The EU VAT Directive (Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax) applies to goods and services sold within the EU. Its aim is to harmonize VAT Law among EU Member States. It specifies that VAT rates must be within a certain range within all EU countries, but leaves it up to member states to decide where in the range their rates will fall. Article 135(1) of the VAT Directive grants an exemption for all “financial services”.In their decision, the CBT concluded that exchanges are providing a financial service and are, therefore, exempt from VAT (per Article 135(1)). Finland’s position can be compared and contrasted with other EU countries.Also Read: Sweden Leads in Cashless TransactionsOther Bitcoin VAT Decisions In EuropeBelgium’s Federal Public Service Finance (FPS) has declared that domestic digital currency transactions are exempt from VAT. The FPS’s reasoning was predicated on the view that Bitcoin was not “a legal means of payment” and therefore could not be subject to VAT. It appears, however, that they may revise their ruling in the future.The UK were yet more emphatic, declaring digital currency transactions to be VAT exempt. This is not the first pro-Bitcoin move that the UK has made recently. Earlier this year, Chancellor Osborne voiced his eagerness to make the UK a Bitcoin hub. Importantly, though, the VAT exemption declared by HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs) will not apply to transactions in which merchants provide goods and services in exchange for Bitcoins. The exemption will only apply to the fees charged on bitcoin-trading transactions.Other member states have adopted more conservative positions. Poland now charges a rate of 23% on bitcoin trades. The director of the tax authorities reasoned that the sale of mined bitcoins was the provision of a service. And given that VAT Law applies to the sale of goods and services, the sale of mined bitcoins would be subject to VAT. In Estonia, adopting a position in diametric opposition to that of Finland, the authorities did not regard the provision of alternative payment instruments as an exempt financial service.Article 135(1) of the EU VAT Directive exempts financial services from VAT throughout the EU. Hence, for any given member state, the issue of whether bitcoin trading should be regarded as a “financial service” is a crucial one. If it is regarded as such by the relevant authority, then it will be VAT exempt. If it is regarded as merely “the provision of a good or service,” then it will be subject to VAT.A Swedish national has recently asked the European Court of Justice (the “Supreme Court of the European Union”) for a “preliminary ruling” that could have wide-reaching ramifications for all EU member states. In the Preliminary Ruling Procedure, the ECJ provides an authoritative and final interpretation of EU Law. The final decision in the case in question is, however, left to the referring court (in this case, Sweden’s Supreme Court). Thus, the law may be interpreted in favor of the complainant, but the complainant may still be deemed to lose by the referring court. This procedure is designed to ensure consistency in the way that EU law applies across EU Member States.Sweden is a leading “bitcoin economy“. Mr David Hedqvist has asked for a preliminary ruling from the ECJ (Case C-264/14). The proprietor of Bitcoin.se has been fighting the Swedish tax agency Sattkevert on the question of whether the services his business provides should be subject to VAT. He is seeking clarification on the question of whether the exchange of virtual currency for traditional currency (and vice-versa) constitutes a service effected for consideration as per Article 2(1) of the Vat Directive and, if so, whether such a service is tax exempt as per Article 135(1). Should the court find it to be a financial service, this will constitute an authoritative ruling in all EU Member States, and all exchanges providing like services will be deemed VAT exempt throughout the EU.Disclaimer: The author owns a small amount of bitcoin, litecoin and ripple.Images from Shutterstock.Advertisement:', ""While the value of Bitcoin has gone up and down, another trend has stayed consistent: The global digital currency is increasingly popular with retailers.Currently, more than 21,000 merchants offer Bitcoin payment options, with some big-name retailers on the list, including Amazon, Overstock, CVS and Expedia.

Тим не менш, зараз зниження курсу, нарешті, зупинилось.Незважаючи на вилучені сервіси анонімної мережі Tor і закриття Інтернет-магазинів з продажу заборонених товарів, нещодавно вартість Bitcoin досягла позначки в $ 400.Така інформація підтверджує, що закриття декількох магазинів, в кінцевому рахунку, не впливає на курс віртуальної валюти, а, значить, попит на Bitcoin залишається незмінним.Зазначимо, що жовтень 2014 був найгіршим місяцем в історії Bitcoin за останній час – вартість цієї валюти впала до $ 319. Однак, пізніше для віртуальних монет настав період відновлення.Аналітики, що працюють з Bitcoin, нагадують, що в листопада 2014 року курс цієї віртуальної валюти злетів у ціні з $ 300 до $ 1 тисячі.Нагадаємо, раніше НБУ повідомив, що валюта Bitcoin забороняється до використання на території України як засіб платежу.Bitcoin – найпопулярніша з усіх існуючих Криптовалюта (""cryptocurrency"", що означає тип електронних грошей, заснованих на криптографії), пише coinside.ru.

People becoming afraid of Ebola on their Euro notes might become a real thing...and all it would take would be one story of someone catching some terrible disease by handling cash, and you’ll see people rushing to the exits to find a more hygienic way of transacting money.”On the future: In 20 years, the world will look “mostly like it looks today.” Most everyone will be “carrying around these wonderful little computers where you can pay anybody in the world, immediately, using something like Bitcoin, or some kind of future, accepted, worldwide global currency.”“Right now, the most important issue for Bitcoin businesses is actually interfacing with the fiat money, with the banking systems around the world.” He continued:“Getting regulatory clarity has been really important. Over the last year, year and a half, certainly in the US and Europe, we’ve seen more regulatory clarity. We’ve seen organizations like the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN) in the US come out with guidance on — if you were doing these certain things with Bitcoin — [they said,] ‘Here are the hoops you need to jump through. Here’s how we’re going to regulate you.’ And I think that’s been really positive for Bitcoin.”Andresen has been heavily involved in Bitcoin since the early days. Only Satoshi Nakamoto has been more so. After discovering Bitcoin in 2010, Andresen worked to help Nakamoto make tweaks and improvements to the software code.Why would a man once given Satoshi’s blessing to manage the Bitcoin project, who earned almost US$210,000 from his work with the Bitcoin Foundation in 2013, call the source of so much benefit to him since 2010 “shady”? The early days of the protocol were the time when he himself was most attracted to it.He expressed more sympathy in the interview for the plight of government regulators than for that of Bitcoin:“Regulators have a hard job. [They] have to react to this new technology and try to fit it into laws that were passed 40, 50, 100 years ago. It really is a struggle with them and you see that in all areas of technology. Since money and banking are probably one of the most heavily regulated sectors, it’s particularly challenging for Bitcoin.”By the last sentence, he means that Bitcoin is more of challenge for regulators, rather than regulators being a challenge for Bitcoin. Never mind that regulators create the laws that make things challenging, and they choose to be a part of the system that enforces century-old laws. They could just as easily choose to “uncreate” old laws, and go find jobs that support innovation, rather than corralling the world under the guise of security and preventing it from moving forward.People like Andresen might then be able to imagine a world that could look significantly different in two decades, rather than “basically the same as today.”First he cleaned up the Bitcoin source code. Then he cleans up the “shadiness” of Bitcoin by supporting “incredibly positive” government regulation. Who masquerades as the Bitcoin redeemer, the government or Andresen?For Bitcoin experts and supporters working in a spotlight, it’s a tough place to be. “Going forward,” he said, “the challenge will be to not get over-regulation that stifles innovation.”Did you enjoy this article?

The member states are granted considerable discretion as to how they will achieve these goals (see Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). “EU Regulations,” in contrast, specify both the goals and the means by which States must achieve them.The EU VAT Directive (Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax) applies to goods and services sold within the EU. Its aim is to harmonize VAT Law among EU Member States. It specifies that VAT rates must be within a certain range within all EU countries, but leaves it up to member states to decide where in the range their rates will fall. Article 135(1) of the VAT Directive grants an exemption for all “financial services”.In their decision, the CBT concluded that exchanges are providing a financial service and are, therefore, exempt from VAT (per Article 135(1)). Finland’s position can be compared and contrasted with other EU countries.Also Read: Sweden Leads in Cashless TransactionsOther Bitcoin VAT Decisions In EuropeBelgium’s Federal Public Service Finance (FPS) has declared that domestic digital currency transactions are exempt from VAT. The FPS’s reasoning was predicated on the view that Bitcoin was not “a legal means of payment” and therefore could not be subject to VAT. It appears, however, that they may revise their ruling in the future.The UK were yet more emphatic, declaring digital currency transactions to be VAT exempt. This is not the first pro-Bitcoin move that the UK has made recently. Earlier this year, Chancellor Osborne voiced his eagerness to make the UK a Bitcoin hub. Importantly, though, the VAT exemption declared by HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs) will not apply to transactions in which merchants provide goods and services in exchange for Bitcoins. The exemption will only apply to the fees charged on bitcoin-trading transactions.Other member states have adopted more conservative positions. Poland now charges a rate of 23% on bitcoin trades. The director of the tax authorities reasoned that the sale of mined bitcoins was the provision of a service. And given that VAT Law applies to the sale of goods and services, the sale of mined bitcoins would be subject to VAT. In Estonia, adopting a position in diametric opposition to that of Finland, the authorities did not regard the provision of alternative payment instruments as an exempt financial service.Article 135(1) of the EU VAT Directive exempts financial services from VAT throughout the EU. Hence, for any given member state, the issue of whether bitcoin trading should be regarded as a “financial service” is a crucial one. If it is regarded as such by the relevant authority, then it will be VAT exempt. If it is regarded as merely “the provision of a good or service,” then it will be subject to VAT.A Swedish national has recently asked the European Court of Justice (the “Supreme Court of the European Union”) for a “preliminary ruling” that could have wide-reaching ramifications for all EU member states. In the Preliminary Ruling Procedure, the ECJ provides an authoritative and final interpretation of EU Law. The final decision in the case in question is, however, left to the referring court (in this case, Sweden’s Supreme Court). Thus, the law may be interpreted in favor of the complainant, but the complainant may still be deemed to lose by the referring court. This procedure is designed to ensure consistency in the way that EU law applies across EU Member States.Sweden is a leading “bitcoin economy“. Mr David Hedqvist has asked for a preliminary ruling from the ECJ (Case C-264/14). The proprietor of Bitcoin.se has been fighting the Swedish tax agency Sattkevert on the question of whether the services his business provides should be subject to VAT. He is seeking clarification on the question of whether the exchange of virtual currency for traditional currency (and vice-versa) constitutes a service effected for consideration as per Article 2(1) of the Vat Directive and, if so, whether such a service is tax exempt as per Article 135(1). Should the court find it to be a financial service, this will constitute an authoritative ruling in all EU Member States, and all exchanges providing like services will be deemed VAT exempt throughout the EU.Disclaimer: The author owns a small amount of bitcoin, litecoin and ripple.Images from Shutterstock.Advertisement:', ""While the value of Bitcoin has gone up and down, another trend has stayed consistent: The global digital currency is increasingly popular with retailers.Currently, more than 21,000 merchants offer Bitcoin payment options, with some big-name retailers on the list, including Amazon, Overstock, CVS and Expedia.

11/16/2014,"['It’s a recurring narrative in stories about Bitcoin and other digital crypto-currencies. Terrorists are out there waiting, ready to descend on the promise of limitless and untraceable financing for attacks.In a fit of panic, governments institute strict regulations on the nascent currencies. In other words, it’s a Bitcoin enthusiast’s worst nightmare.There’s a grain of truth in this story. It’s certainly true that terrorists—like those affiliated with Islamic State—are looking at crypto-currencies as a means to move money without spies and law enforcement agencies tracking them.But as a widespread way to circumvent currency controls, it’s not really taking off. That’s according to a new report by CTC Sentinel, West Point’s counter-terror journal.Even as terror groups like Islamic State become more sophisticated—and even as they begin to use crypto-currencies more often—it’s still likely to be a marginal source of financing, at best.“While these tools have gained in popularity, in recent years their expansion into various terrorist organizations has been slow and deliberate and has not matched pace with transnational criminal uses of these same technologies,” states Aaron Brantly, the report’s author and a professor of cybersecurity at the United States Military Academy at West Point.The crux of the problem for Islamic State is that these currencies are really not as anonymous as popularly assumed. They’re the opposite of anonymous, in at least one important respect.Currencies like Bitcoin rely on openly sharing all transaction information across the entire network. Everyone can see the entire history of transactions involving the currency.This has several advantages. For one, this builds trust by showing that currency flowing from one place to another is in fact doing just that. Also, the history makes it harder to pull off a scam, like simultaneously paying for two different things—from two owners—with the same Bitcoin and stiffing one or both.What’s anonymous is where the money is coming from and where it’s going, except for an address—tied to one or more private keys—which the sender can reconfigure after every transaction. That’s just enough for sleuths to potentially pinpoint your identity.Even better is that spies have the entire transaction history at their fingertips.', 'Jonathan Levin is a digital currency consultant and entrepreneur. He previously co-founded and served as CEO of Coinometrics.In an age of microblogging and relentless conferencing, zeitgeist is not written in novels but in phrases shorter than 140 characters.One cannot leave a FinTech or digital currency conference without hearing some rendition of ""I love the blockchain, just not bitcoin"". However, as with most clichés, the phrase actually addresses the core of the issue: it begs for a defense of blockchains and the bitcoin blockchain as the best in-class.Blockchains are data structures that have two distinct features:They have native tokens that form the basis of all recorded information and economic incentives for using the system. The tokens are native as they are governed by the protocol that governs the data structure and have no external dependencies like central banks or financial institutions. They contain a chain of cryptographic proofs that ensures the data has not been tampered with, lest the chain of proofs would not be able to be reconstructed. The chain of proofs has the neat property that it reveals the amount of work it took to construct the chain. This enables the network to converge on one chain as the true chain, the one with the most work done, and discard all but one.The title of this article addresses a key challenge that has been the cause for much debate in the industry: do we need to have only one native token with a fixed supply in our data structure, or could we have none – or many?To miss the value of these native tokens would be to also miss the value of the data structures that store them. I would like to push for blockchains with native tokens rather than just blockchains (innovative, probabilistically immutable databases) which have far lower utility, if any at all.Security and integrityWithout going into the technical details of how blockchains are secured, it\'s important to understand the native token as the incentive mechanism for the security and integrity of the blockchain (for those that want a technical overview of the security model see the dynamic-membership multi-party signatures explained in the recent sidechains whitepaper).At the base level, the blockchain technology is a data structure that contains within it a chain of proofs that must hold true. This structure allows us to verify that the history of transactions or information that is being presented has not been altered or tampered with, ensuring data integrity.The reliability of the proofs is directly dependent on the economic incentives provided to the people or organizations that supply the proofs.In bitcoin, a miner that earns the right to publish a block on the main chain is currently paid 25 BTC (roughly $9,500 at publication time). This provides adequate incentives to have highly specialized hardware running in data centers around the world.If the reward halved, as it is set to do in 2016, the incentive to provide these proofs would halve and we could likely see a scenario where the proofs would then be far less reliable (partly due to the excess hardware that could be bought on the cheap). In other words, without a high token value on a blockchain, there is little security or integrity of the data contained within.Universal financial coverageThere are relatively few bitcoin business models out there that are truly harnessing the ability to provide universal financial coverage, due to a number of factors like supply chain limitations, regulatory barriers and bitcoin’s volatility. Isn’t then the obvious solution to do away with bitcoin and keep the blockchain?Without a native token, though, and with only a decentralized and open ledger we cannot achieve universal financial coverage. Financial institutions that adopt, co-opt, or fork the blockchain technology will produce no better financial coverage than they do at present.To see why this is the case, we can look at the following examples of applications that have been built on the basis of financial coverage (note this is not an endorsement of any of these services, rather an examination of their use of universal financial coverage).The Dogetipbot and more recently Changetip have created a frenzy on Reddit. A simple web scraper enables people around the globe to transmit value by typing a few words into a website.The tips themselves are all recorded in centralized databases so the “low cost” of cryptocurrencies is irrelevant. The important factor is that the coverage is truly universal and that any user can, when they choose, withdraw the bitcoin or dogecoin from the service and use it in their everyday life.In the future, this could become the basis of integrating virtual realities with physical processes.Drug marketplaces needing to avoid criminal clampdowns and deliver truly global marketplaces require universal financial coverage (as well as relative anonymity). The extent of the coverage enables these platforms to gain critical mass to win the trust of their user base. Cross-country supply chain integration is possible because of the extent of financial inclusion.Gambling sites are some of the only places in the cryptocurrency ecosystem that do not give dollar or fiat equivalent currency units. Sites like SatoshiDice and Updown give the bettors information on the extent of the house edge.The volumes going through these sites are incredibly impressive considering that the operators often conceal their identity and are potentially operating illegally in certain parts of the world.The demand for transactions is somewhat insulated from bitcoin volatility since the house edge can be as large as 70% on a binary option. Their user growth and reputation was again only achievable due to the universal financial coverage (bitcoin) and ability to independently audit their processes (blockchain).One of the most popular bitcoin casinos, Just-Dice, conducts their bets off-chain. Wagers are not recorded in the bitcoin blockchain and are only stored on the Just-Dice servers.With over 1 billion bets made on the platform, it\'s clear that the key advantage is universal financial coverage. While there is not the ability to independently audit their processes via a blockchain, bitcoin casinos like Just-Dice provide provably fair gambling.There is no reason that traditional gambling services could not do this as well, but we seem content to rely on their real-world reputation and the certification of their services by some gambling authority.Model for innovationThe underlying blockchain technology relies on universal financial coverage and distributed computing to achieve its value as one of the first databases with provable integrity.Centralized services may operate on top of the bitcoin protocol but will always face high competition due to the relatively low barriers to entry (open source software) and low switching costs (installing apps on a smart phone).We are still early in our understanding of blockchain technology. The excitement around the integrity of the ledger, its openness and its potential to unlock global financial inclusion must be embraced in a holistic framework. The blockchain’s security and utility depend on its native token. Currently the most secure and reliable blockchain is clearly our dear friend bitcoin, but this does not have to be the case forever.This article has been republished here with permission from the author.

Gallop finds that necessities like VC funding, bank accounts and video streaming platforms usually read “no adult content” in the small print.As many business owners do, Gallop is cautiously and slowly approaching the Bitcoin space. We thought we’d reach out to her and give her a warm crypto welcome.CoinTelegraph: What did you see or experience that compelled you to bring a new paradigm to the sex industry?Cindy Gallop: MakeLoveNotPorn is a complete and total accident. I never set out to do anything that I’m doing now.Years before the media picked up on this, I was encountering an issue which would have never crossed my mind. When the freedom of access to hardcore porn met society’s reluctance to talk openly about sex, those two factors resulted in negative sex education. I thought, if I’m experiencing this, most people will as well.I’m an action-oriented person, so six years ago I put up my money for a very basic website to contrast hardcore porn with the real world. I launched at TED, and made a deliberate decision to be explicit in my talk because I knew my audience would not get it. I’m the only person to say “come on my face” at TED.The talk drove an extraordinary response. I began getting huge traffic from all over the world. Every day for the past six years, I have received thousands of emails from young and old, male and female, straight and gay, from everywhere in the world.I would like to emphasize the issue is not porn, it is the complete absence of an open, healthy, honest conversation about sex in the real world.CT: When you first launched the site, there was no video. But now you have MakeLoveNotPorn.tv. How’s that been?CG: A little over 20 months ago, we launched our user-generated, crowdsourced [video platform] to encourage people to submit their real world sex videos. It’s not about performing for the camera, it’s about capturing the real world. We curate to make sure it’s real and have a sharing revenue model.CT: Do you feel that hardcore, “unrealistic” porn shapes real world interactions between sexes?CG: The short answer is, yes, of course.Long answer: there are a number of dimensions to this. First of all, I get very frustrated when people use the word “porn” like it is all one, big homogeneous mass. That’s like using the world “literature” as if it were all just the same.One of the problems currently is that virtually all of us watch porn, but we never talk about it. Porn exists in the shadowy underworld—a parallel universe. When you force something into the underground, you force bad things to happen and stifle the conversation.Porn lacks curation and navigation. There is no Yelp of porn. That’s a problem, because this navigation is needed for young people. Everything on our site is socially acceptable and sharable. Our criteria is literally that you can have your computer open and there could be kids running next to you and as long as you’re not streaming, the content is fine.We had a woman write to us saying that when she was in college watching porn, she found the ghastly porn ads unbearable. She put Post-Its around the porn site so she could circumvent the ads and watch the porn she wanted.We have no socially acceptable vocabulary for porn—“getting her ass railed/pounded/banged.” We are creating a new language for real world sex. We want people to take this language and use it to talk about sex in the real world—language you can use to talk about what you want to do in bed in a celebratory manner.“The top-down model is broken. There is a new bottom-up model of connected people and connected action.” - Cindy GallopCT: How do you feel this will impact people's perceptions of the sex industry?CG: In my consulting work and public speaking, which I do predominantly about business, I am living my own business motto: The top-down model is broken. There is a new bottom-up model of connected people and connected action.While people see how it works in the Arab Spring, they forsake it in business.The shame people feel about sex is the same cause of many areas of massive human unhappiness. MakeLoveNotPorn operates in the market of human happiness.Sex and death are the two universal human conditions. In that sense, when you are allowed to be sensual, and normalize that, the results are extraordinary.This is the financial opportunity that close-minded investors do not see. The money to be made in this area—oh my god. No one thinks it’s possible. Money to be made out of sex? But the market never goes away.The second area is the market for socially-acceptable sex. You potentially double, triple, and quadruple returns when people feel publicly okay to buy into these services. That’s the future.“The three huge areas of disruption today are sex, cannabis, and Bitcoin.” - Cindy GallopCT: You have faced many systemic challenges that Bitcoin has faced on the journey to acceptance - PayPal, Chase, Amazon, Android and Apple banned you. How have you handled this and where have you found solutions?CG: I haven’t. As part of my battle to open up people’s minds, I use analogies all of the time. The three huge areas of disruption today are sex, cannabis, and Bitcoin. Investors are rushing into Bitcoin and cannabis long before they are doing so for sex.We still don’t have a bank account and are still looking for funding. In terms of taking payments, the key thing about any business partner you work with is they have to want to make it happen. I found a partner like that in Europe, I had to register in Europe to get an account at Wire Card. We were put into the “high risk merchant” division.We’re getting decent rates and can process Mastercard and Visa. We come up as a “high risk” code, which causes people to receive alerts on their credit card for fraud. Our community will call their banks to explain what the transaction is. There’s strong support from community members.CT: Biggest challenge you will face in the future?CG: I believe in playing the long game. Fuck hyper growth. It does not matter how slowly you go, as long as you do not stop.I know the potential for this venture, which is why I keep going. People came out of the woodworks after my TED talk, so glad that someone was finally broaching this subject. Which is why I don’t understand when people don’t see its value. What is it worth to you to ensure that your kid doesn’t grow up fucked up?CT: Are you going to be accepting Bitcoin on your platform in the future?CG: Our members would love to take Bitcoin, but we cannot build our own wallet. We need a Bitcoin merchant who loves what were doing, totally supports us, and is willing to sink their teeth into what we’re working on.Are you a crypto payment processor, investor, programmer or adviser who’s interested in assisting MLNP bring cryptocurrency to their business?

Financial institutions that adopt, co-opt, or fork the blockchain technology will produce no better financial coverage than they do at present.To see why this is the case, we can look at the following examples of applications that have been built on the basis of financial coverage (note this is not an endorsement of any of these services, rather an examination of their use of universal financial coverage).The Dogetipbot and more recently Changetip have created a frenzy on Reddit. A simple web scraper enables people around the globe to transmit value by typing a few words into a website.The tips themselves are all recorded in centralized databases so the “low cost” of cryptocurrencies is irrelevant. The important factor is that the coverage is truly universal and that any user can, when they choose, withdraw the bitcoin or dogecoin from the service and use it in their everyday life.In the future, this could become the basis of integrating virtual realities with physical processes.Drug marketplaces needing to avoid criminal clampdowns and deliver truly global marketplaces require universal financial coverage (as well as relative anonymity). The extent of the coverage enables these platforms to gain critical mass to win the trust of their user base. Cross-country supply chain integration is possible because of the extent of financial inclusion.Gambling sites are some of the only places in the cryptocurrency ecosystem that do not give dollar or fiat equivalent currency units. Sites like SatoshiDice and Updown give the bettors information on the extent of the house edge.The volumes going through these sites are incredibly impressive considering that the operators often conceal their identity and are potentially operating illegally in certain parts of the world.The demand for transactions is somewhat insulated from bitcoin volatility since the house edge can be as large as 70% on a binary option. Their user growth and reputation was again only achievable due to the universal financial coverage (bitcoin) and ability to independently audit their processes (blockchain).One of the most popular bitcoin casinos, Just-Dice, conducts their bets off-chain. Wagers are not recorded in the bitcoin blockchain and are only stored on the Just-Dice servers.With over 1 billion bets made on the platform, it\'s clear that the key advantage is universal financial coverage. While there is not the ability to independently audit their processes via a blockchain, bitcoin casinos like Just-Dice provide provably fair gambling.There is no reason that traditional gambling services could not do this as well, but we seem content to rely on their real-world reputation and the certification of their services by some gambling authority.Model for innovationThe underlying blockchain technology relies on universal financial coverage and distributed computing to achieve its value as one of the first databases with provable integrity.Centralized services may operate on top of the bitcoin protocol but will always face high competition due to the relatively low barriers to entry (open source software) and low switching costs (installing apps on a smart phone).We are still early in our understanding of blockchain technology. The excitement around the integrity of the ledger, its openness and its potential to unlock global financial inclusion must be embraced in a holistic framework. The blockchain’s security and utility depend on its native token. Currently the most secure and reliable blockchain is clearly our dear friend bitcoin, but this does not have to be the case forever.This article has been republished here with permission from the author.

Gallop finds that necessities like VC funding, bank accounts and video streaming platforms usually read “no adult content” in the small print.As many business owners do, Gallop is cautiously and slowly approaching the Bitcoin space. We thought we’d reach out to her and give her a warm crypto welcome.CoinTelegraph: What did you see or experience that compelled you to bring a new paradigm to the sex industry?Cindy Gallop: MakeLoveNotPorn is a complete and total accident. I never set out to do anything that I’m doing now.Years before the media picked up on this, I was encountering an issue which would have never crossed my mind. When the freedom of access to hardcore porn met society’s reluctance to talk openly about sex, those two factors resulted in negative sex education. I thought, if I’m experiencing this, most people will as well.I’m an action-oriented person, so six years ago I put up my money for a very basic website to contrast hardcore porn with the real world. I launched at TED, and made a deliberate decision to be explicit in my talk because I knew my audience would not get it. I’m the only person to say “come on my face” at TED.The talk drove an extraordinary response. I began getting huge traffic from all over the world. Every day for the past six years, I have received thousands of emails from young and old, male and female, straight and gay, from everywhere in the world.I would like to emphasize the issue is not porn, it is the complete absence of an open, healthy, honest conversation about sex in the real world.CT: When you first launched the site, there was no video. But now you have MakeLoveNotPorn.tv. How’s that been?CG: A little over 20 months ago, we launched our user-generated, crowdsourced [video platform] to encourage people to submit their real world sex videos. It’s not about performing for the camera, it’s about capturing the real world. We curate to make sure it’s real and have a sharing revenue model.CT: Do you feel that hardcore, “unrealistic” porn shapes real world interactions between sexes?CG: The short answer is, yes, of course.Long answer: there are a number of dimensions to this. First of all, I get very frustrated when people use the word “porn” like it is all one, big homogeneous mass. That’s like using the world “literature” as if it were all just the same.One of the problems currently is that virtually all of us watch porn, but we never talk about it. Porn exists in the shadowy underworld—a parallel universe. When you force something into the underground, you force bad things to happen and stifle the conversation.Porn lacks curation and navigation. There is no Yelp of porn. That’s a problem, because this navigation is needed for young people. Everything on our site is socially acceptable and sharable. Our criteria is literally that you can have your computer open and there could be kids running next to you and as long as you’re not streaming, the content is fine.We had a woman write to us saying that when she was in college watching porn, she found the ghastly porn ads unbearable. She put Post-Its around the porn site so she could circumvent the ads and watch the porn she wanted.We have no socially acceptable vocabulary for porn—“getting her ass railed/pounded/banged.” We are creating a new language for real world sex. We want people to take this language and use it to talk about sex in the real world—language you can use to talk about what you want to do in bed in a celebratory manner.“The top-down model is broken. There is a new bottom-up model of connected people and connected action.” - Cindy GallopCT: How do you feel this will impact people's perceptions of the sex industry?CG: In my consulting work and public speaking, which I do predominantly about business, I am living my own business motto: The top-down model is broken. There is a new bottom-up model of connected people and connected action.While people see how it works in the Arab Spring, they forsake it in business.The shame people feel about sex is the same cause of many areas of massive human unhappiness. MakeLoveNotPorn operates in the market of human happiness.Sex and death are the two universal human conditions. In that sense, when you are allowed to be sensual, and normalize that, the results are extraordinary.This is the financial opportunity that close-minded investors do not see. The money to be made in this area—oh my god. No one thinks it’s possible. Money to be made out of sex? But the market never goes away.The second area is the market for socially-acceptable sex. You potentially double, triple, and quadruple returns when people feel publicly okay to buy into these services. That’s the future.“The three huge areas of disruption today are sex, cannabis, and Bitcoin.” - Cindy GallopCT: You have faced many systemic challenges that Bitcoin has faced on the journey to acceptance - PayPal, Chase, Amazon, Android and Apple banned you. How have you handled this and where have you found solutions?CG: I haven’t. As part of my battle to open up people’s minds, I use analogies all of the time. The three huge areas of disruption today are sex, cannabis, and Bitcoin. Investors are rushing into Bitcoin and cannabis long before they are doing so for sex.We still don’t have a bank account and are still looking for funding. In terms of taking payments, the key thing about any business partner you work with is they have to want to make it happen. I found a partner like that in Europe, I had to register in Europe to get an account at Wire Card. We were put into the “high risk merchant” division.We’re getting decent rates and can process Mastercard and Visa. We come up as a “high risk” code, which causes people to receive alerts on their credit card for fraud. Our community will call their banks to explain what the transaction is. There’s strong support from community members.CT: Biggest challenge you will face in the future?CG: I believe in playing the long game. Fuck hyper growth. It does not matter how slowly you go, as long as you do not stop.I know the potential for this venture, which is why I keep going. People came out of the woodworks after my TED talk, so glad that someone was finally broaching this subject. Which is why I don’t understand when people don’t see its value. What is it worth to you to ensure that your kid doesn’t grow up fucked up?CT: Are you going to be accepting Bitcoin on your platform in the future?CG: Our members would love to take Bitcoin, but we cannot build our own wallet. We need a Bitcoin merchant who loves what were doing, totally supports us, and is willing to sink their teeth into what we’re working on.Are you a crypto payment processor, investor, programmer or adviser who’s interested in assisting MLNP bring cryptocurrency to their business?

Tas ir aktuāli gan ikdienā, gan it īpaši krīzes situācijās, kad piekļuve naudas līdzekļiem var tikt ierobežota.Kā galvenās jaunās valūtas priekšrocības Matoniss minēja arī tās augsto tehnoloģisko aizsardzību pret krāpšanos un hakeru uzbrukumiem, nulles inflāciju, iespēju veikt neierobežotu skaitu tūlītēju maksājumu, niecīgās apstrādes izmaksas, kā arī brīvo tiešsaistes tirdzniecību jebkurā pasaules valstī, tostarp arī Āfrikas valstīs, kur daudziem iedzīvotājiem nav kontu bankās.«Šodien jau ir acīmredzams, ka mobilajiem maksājumiem pieder nākotne, bet elektroniskā nauda (bitcoin) ir gatavs ideāls šo maksājumu instruments,» uzskata Matoniss.«Bitcoin Foundation» līderis ir pārliecināts, ka jaunā valūta principiāli jau ir gatava konkurēt ar tradicionālajiem maksājumu instrumentiem. Viņš atsaucās uz statistikas datiem, kas liecina, ka pēdējo piecu gadu laikā elektroniskās naudas tirgus kapitalizācija katru gadu palielinājās vairāk nekā desmitkārt, un šobrīd tās vērtība tiek lēsta ap septiņiem miljardiem ASV dolāru (5,6 miljardi eiro). Elektroniskās naudas maku skaits katru gadu palielinās astoņkārtīgi. Turklāt, ja 2009.gadā, kad parādījās pirmā elektroniskā nauda, norēķini ar to tika ierobežoti, tad tagad to kā maksājuma instrumentu pieņem jau visās pasaules valstīs.Elektroniskās naudas kvantitatīvais apgrozījums, pēc Matonisa vārdiem, jau ir pārsniedzis «Western Union» apgrozījumu, un tas tuvojas «PayPal» sistēmas maksājumu sistēmas apjomiem. «Mēs strauji tuvojamies finanšu galvenajai plūsmai,» secināja Matoniss.']"

12/25/2014,"['It\'s December 25th. You’re busy heaping cranberry sauce on your plate and stealthily dodging those brussel sprouts when, as you knew it would, the conversation turns to bitcoin.Statistically speaking, the majority of your family have probably heard of the digital currency by now – no doubt in the context of Gox, Silk Road (both 1 and 2) and pundits declaring that it\'s dead, yet again, following the latest price bubble.They might have also seen an interview with Bitcoin\'s CEO, noticed that its \'stock\' has tumbled or read about Newsweek\'s \'unmasking\' of Dorian Nakamoto – bitcoin\'s creator who, despite his digital fortune, is apparently living a humble life in LA with his elderly mother.For this reason, addressing the question ‘What is bitcoin?\' in 2014 is less about providing a 101 than countering the bric-a-brac of misinformation people have picked up in passing. Here are five tips to help you nail your answer so you can get back to the real issue at hand: the food.Tailor itRule number one: know your audience.Back in January, Nik Custodio wrote an article explaining bitcoin for a five-year-old using the concept of \'digital apples\'. It works because it was written on his audience\'s terms and in a language they could understand – something that often escapes bitcoin\'s evangelical ranks.For example, your teenage cousin is more likely to understand emerging payment technologies like SnapCash and ApplePay than the octogenarians in the room. Use this to your advantage.They might not be a goldbug or a cryptographer, but do they like Microsoft? Are they into crowdfunding? Financial inclusion? Doge? Pinpoint something that interests them and work from there.Really, you can get as tenuous as you like. Do they listen to rap? Watch Two and a Half Men? Great, kick off with a mention of 50 ""all money is money"" Cent, drone-loving Snoop Dogg and BitPay backer Ashton Kutcher.Use gadgetsIf you\'re completely lost for words – or, more likely, your mouth is full – grab the nearest smartphone or tablet and queue up some videos.Previously, We Use Coins was the go-to resource for an easy introduction to bitcoin. However, there are now a number of different options out there that give a handle on the basics.In our rundown of the best bitcoin explainers, Vox and The Guardian came tops for addressing the protocol\'s “permissionless innovation” and its ability to cut out the middleman, respectively.Whichever you choose, a video is an easy option to get most of the heavy lifting out the way. Merry streaming.Compare itWe’ve all heard Marc Andreessen and others explain how bitcoin is like the Internet, both as a network technology and a highly controversial topic among regulators.Other comparisons – an email for money, a kind of \'digital gold\' – can be a useful way to tap into something familiar and relatable. So Einstein\'s saying goes: ""If you can\'t explain it simply, you don\'t understand it well enough.""Beyond metaphors, the Gartner Hype Cycle is also useful for comparing how bitcoin fits into the broader lifecycle of new technologies.Bitcoin: it\'s the next ... well, anything you like really.Fix somethingIn a recent interview with CoinDesk, Western Union\'s CIO John \'David\' Thompson revealed he still sees bitcoin as a ""solution looking for a problem to solve"".While entrepreneurs are still searching for its \'killer app\', on a basic level, bitcoin does fix a well-known problem in computer science: the double-spend problem – how to transfer (and not duplicate) digital assets from one person to another.If you\'ve got a patient audience, it\'s worth delving into why this ""legit computer science breakthrough"", as Ben Horowitz describes it, has made strides in an area that was once dismissed as impossible.Alternatively, try \'fixing\' something a bit less technical. This could be a personal \'fix\' you\'ve encountered (helping to split the bill at the end of a meal, for example) or something wider-reaching like, say, making finance more inclusive or cutting transaction fees for charities.Make predictionsWhile predictions for a $10,000 bitcoin within the next year now seem a little overzealous, many investors in the digital currency space look to the future to explain why it is worth bothering with now.It\'s becoming trendy to favour the prospects of the blockchain (as well as other 2.0 projects) over bitcoin \'the currency\'. While the two are codependent and, by design, cannot separate, many commentators think the technology behind bitcoin will trump its primary monetary function to become a multi-use platform for innovation.What about future growth? Well, you could nod to the total investment poured into bitcoin companies so far, $300m and counting. Alternatively, you could cite the demise of pets.com – up to you.Most importantly, be objective – it\'s an explanation, not a sales pitch. Your end-goal shouldn\'t be about winning someone over or baffling them with jargon, but giving them enough information to formulate an opinion of their own.When all is said and done, they might dismiss the viability of a volatile currency with slow user growth – fine.

You’re busy heaping cranberry sauce on your plate and stealthily dodging those brussel sprouts when, as you knew it would, the conversation turns to bitcoin.Statistically speaking, the majority of your family have probably heard of the digital currency by now – no doubt in the context of Gox, Silk Road (both 1 and 2) and pundits declaring that it\'s dead, yet again, following the latest price bubble.They might have also seen an interview with Bitcoin\'s CEO, noticed that its \'stock\' has tumbled or read about Newsweek\'s \'unmasking\' of Dorian Nakamoto – bitcoin\'s creator who, despite his digital fortune, is apparently living a humble life in LA with his elderly mother.For this reason, addressing the question ‘What is bitcoin?\' in 2014 is less about providing a 101 than countering the bric-a-brac of misinformation people have picked up in passing. Here are five tips to help you nail your answer so you can get back to the real issue at hand: the food.Tailor itRule number one: know your audience.Back in January, Nik Custodio wrote an article explaining bitcoin for a five-year-old using the concept of \'digital apples\'. It works because it was written on his audience\'s terms and in a language they could understand – something that often escapes bitcoin\'s evangelical ranks.For example, your teenage cousin is more likely to understand emerging payment technologies like SnapCash and ApplePay than the octogenarians in the room. Use this to your advantage.They might not be a goldbug or a cryptographer, but do they like Microsoft? Are they into crowdfunding? Financial inclusion? Doge? Pinpoint something that interests them and work from there.Really, you can get as tenuous as you like. Do they listen to rap? Watch Two and a Half Men? Great, kick off with a mention of 50 ""all money is money"" Cent, drone-loving Snoop Dogg and BitPay backer Ashton Kutcher.Use gadgetsIf you\'re completely lost for words – or, more likely, your mouth is full – grab the nearest smartphone or tablet and queue up some videos.Previously, We Use Coins was the go-to resource for an easy introduction to bitcoin. However, there are now a number of different options out there that give a handle on the basics.In our rundown of the best bitcoin explainers, Vox and The Guardian came tops for addressing the protocol\'s “permissionless innovation” and its ability to cut out the middleman, respectively.Whichever you choose, a video is an easy option to get most of the heavy lifting out the way. Merry streaming.Compare itWe’ve all heard Marc Andreessen and others explain how bitcoin is like the Internet, both as a network technology and a highly controversial topic among regulators.Other comparisons – an email for money, a kind of \'digital gold\' – can be a useful way to tap into something familiar and relatable. So Einstein\'s saying goes: ""If you can\'t explain it simply, you don\'t understand it well enough.""Beyond metaphors, the Gartner Hype Cycle is also useful for comparing how bitcoin fits into the broader lifecycle of new technologies.Bitcoin: it\'s the next ... well, anything you like really.Fix somethingIn a recent interview with CoinDesk, Western Union\'s CIO John \'David\' Thompson revealed he still sees bitcoin as a ""solution looking for a problem to solve"".While entrepreneurs are still searching for its \'killer app\', on a basic level, bitcoin does fix a well-known problem in computer science: the double-spend problem – how to transfer (and not duplicate) digital assets from one person to another.If you\'ve got a patient audience, it\'s worth delving into why this ""legit computer science breakthrough"", as Ben Horowitz describes it, has made strides in an area that was once dismissed as impossible.Alternatively, try \'fixing\' something a bit less technical. This could be a personal \'fix\' you\'ve encountered (helping to split the bill at the end of a meal, for example) or something wider-reaching like, say, making finance more inclusive or cutting transaction fees for charities.Make predictionsWhile predictions for a $10,000 bitcoin within the next year now seem a little overzealous, many investors in the digital currency space look to the future to explain why it is worth bothering with now.It\'s becoming trendy to favour the prospects of the blockchain (as well as other 2.0 projects) over bitcoin \'the currency\'. While the two are codependent and, by design, cannot separate, many commentators think the technology behind bitcoin will trump its primary monetary function to become a multi-use platform for innovation.What about future growth? Well, you could nod to the total investment poured into bitcoin companies so far, $300m and counting. Alternatively, you could cite the demise of pets.com – up to you.Most importantly, be objective – it\'s an explanation, not a sales pitch. Your end-goal shouldn\'t be about winning someone over or baffling them with jargon, but giving them enough information to formulate an opinion of their own.When all is said and done, they might dismiss the viability of a volatile currency with slow user growth – fine.
