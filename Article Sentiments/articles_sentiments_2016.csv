01/10/2016,"[""About The AuthorJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'The term “financial inclusion” is a new buzzword in the fintech space. With the rise of services like Abra and MPesa, we are convinced that bitcoin is the solution to the problems of the unbanked. With bitcoin, we say, the house cleaner in Dubai can get her money home and the refugee can get his money over the border into a safer place.I’m even known to wax poetic about the topic. That’s fine. Optimism is a wonderful tonic for the soul. But we have entered a bubble made of cryptocurrency buzzwords and it’s important to assess what is going to happen over the next few years. In short, right now the bitcoin infrastructure is insufficient to support the unbanked. This must and will change.Before we begin, a bit of disclosure: I’ve been researching this for my own project, Freemit, and I’ve been talking to startups in this space. There are many differing views and I absolutely want the unbanked to receive the help they deserve. But it’s up to the entire industry to shift its practices to help the neediest.First, let’s discuss the unbanked in the US. Mehrsa Baradaran’s excellent book, How The Other Half Banks, tells of the fall of the rural bank and the growth of predatory and pernicious banking. During the early years of the banking industry, when the US was an agrarian society, each small town or community had its own bank. These multiple mini-banks served the community directly and were often the only place a farmer could get a loan before next year’s harvest. These mini-banks are what we think of when we imagine the nefarious landowner and banker in small town America – their whims could make or break a farm. The truth was that these small banks were the lifeblood of early America.Regulatory changes created nationwide banks that slowly subsumed the smaller banks. These tiny banks fell or were bought and the resulting banking deserts further gutted the agrarian towns and led to the growth of industrial America and its various discontents. You could now sell your soul to the company store and, further, deal with a faceless bank that had no connection to your local community. You could also get a large mortgage that let you buy a home in the suburbs and, barring the occasional horrible crash, that has been said to hold us all in good stead.Now, thanks to the hollowing out of bank branches, we have payday loans where a $600 loan can balloon to $2000 in fees and the only ATMs available feature a $3 fee. Once again, this is not always the case and this pessimistic view of the banking core but this same situation repeats itself in New York to Jakarta.But how do you solve this? Bitcoin will be the solution, but not until the entrenched players open connectors to the entire blockchain network – which, obviously, goes against the big banks special “internal blockchain” efforts. The banks still think that the blockchain is like the Internet – there should exist special private networks that only they can use “for security’s sake.” This is evocative of companies, back in 1999 or so, who wanted special VPNs for their companies so the big bad Internet – a catalyst for change that remade the world – wouldn’t interfere with their TPS reports.What the banks are really saying is they want to pull the jet engines off of the blockchain 747 but they don’t want to deal with all the smelly passengers and headstrong pilot. It’s folly that will soon be remedied.Still, this doesn’t solve the problems of the unbanked. Here are some pressing issues.The unbanked want to remain anonymous. A bank owner I spoke to noted that the primary problem in serving the unbanked is that they live in a cash economy. They want to remain anonymous for various reasons, be they immigration status, fear, or distrust of banks. The only way to solve this is to rewrite the onerous rules associated with closed networks like Western Union to allow the unbanked to use completely transparent networks. Regulations are scaring off money sending projects because they were written for a more barbaric age. This can only change but will take effort by the industry to move the perception that anonymous money sending is the tool of terrorists and drug dealers. By allowing $100 in cash to move anonymously you are helping a poor worker and not a gangster. The gangsters have their own ways to move money and $100 is a pittance.The unbanked live in places where predatory banking is more convenient. New School professor Lisa Servon said in a PBS story that “having quick access to their money is one big reason low-income people choose not to use traditional banks”“The South Bronx has only one bank per 20,000 residents,” she said. This means that check cashing and money changing spots, not to mention money sending kiosks that charge high rates, are the go to spots for transactions. New ideas like human ATMs are definitely interesting and work in places like Hong Kong where maids can visit a mall to send money home and where many small bitcoin remittance plays like are thriving.But these are small markets and not interesting to the big banks or big investors. Like, say, the Netscape browser in the early days of the Internet, these services are the small strange outliers that will eventually grow enormous.The unbanked are difficult to address. Acquiring unbanked customers that will trust your brand is difficult. That’s why the tools associated with Internet banking must first address the early adopter. The first mobile phones were found primarily inside expensive cars. Now they are found in every pocket around the world. This means the phone has moved from a tool for the rich (like bitcoin right now) to a tool for everyone.The first Internet shops required contacts at a hedge fund to start and hundreds of engineers to understand (like bitcoin). Anyone now can can use the tools created by that company to build anything they want. The barrier to building an Internet startup is basically an understanding of a little code. The same thing will happen in banking. As these apps become more usable the banking deserts will be no more since we will soon have a bank in our pocket that can do more than pay a few bills.GET IT HERE Shop ? What is this? Amazon Shop buttons are programmatically attached to our reviews. TechCrunch receives revenue for shopping activity generated by the links. Because the buttons are attached programmatically, they should not be interpreted as editorial endorsements.Smaller countries do not have bitcoin liquidity. As I’ve explored our own project, I’ve heard again and again of startups that failed because bitcoin is illiquid in the poorest countries. That’s why the best startups are sending phone minutes over borders or releasing debit cards that can be topped up remotely. These are alternative forms of value that can land in a country without proper infrastructure or access to cryptocurrenies and help people immediately. It will take a long time before the truly poor will even know about bitcoin and even then there is no reason to even discuss it. Instead it should be the sharpest sword in the arsenal of banking inclusion and fintech should work hard to ensure that the policies created now will help everyone, not just the rich.The bitcoin infrastructure is excellent, secure, and powerful in the abstract. In practice it is useless… but not for long. Fiat in and fiat out will become a real thing this year – hundreds of folks are working on the project – but to focus on the unbanked does nothing to interest big banks. They’ve already quite well ignored that subset of the world. I predict a number of exciting changes to this in the next year but it will take time for the true promise of bitcoin to express itself. When that happens we will see an engine of change that will rival the Internet in power and reach.', 'You can call Ledger Wallet CEO Eric Larchevêque the Winklevoss of France given that he stores around 1,000 bitcoins on his bitcoin wallet — that’s around $450,000 as of today. But it also shows how secure the company’s wallet is. I interviewed him on our stage at CES.Ledger Wallet’s first product was a sort of USB key that you would unlock using a PIN code. Now what happens if you lose it? Your bitcoins are safe as you need a private key to send these bitcoins. You can even recover your wallet and transfer your bitcoins to a new wallet.In other words, Ledger Wallet multiplies the number of factors to access your bitcoins, including a physical element. And even if your computer is infected, hackers can’t access your bitcoins as the most important part of the code is executed from the wallet directly.The company also showcased a new wallet, the Ledger Blue. It has a touch screen, supports USB, Bluetooth and NFC and uses the same kind of mechanisms as the company’s previous wallet.I also asked Larchevêque what he thought about the current climate around bitcoin. He’s still bullish but things it won’t become as ubiquitous as people previously expected. And he probably means what he says given how many bitcoins he personally owns.', 'Dolar byl proti Bitcoinu p?i vstupu do roku 2016 o 35 procent slabší než p?ed rokem.

Yes, these are cool. But much bigger things happened last year.A broad range of technologies reached a tipping point, from science projects or objects of convenience for the rich, to inventions that will transform humanity. We haven’t seen anything of this magnitude since the invention of the printing press in the 1400s. And this is just the beginning.Starting in 2016, a wider range of technologies will begin to reach their tipping points.Here are the six amazing transformations we just saw.The Internet And KnowledgeIn the developed world, we have become used to having devices that connect and inform us and provide services on demand, and the developing world has largely been in the dark. As of 2015, however, nearly half of China’s population and a fifth of India’s population have gained Internet connectivity. India now has more Internet users than does the U.S., and China has twice as many.Smartphones with the capabilities of today’s iPhone will cost less than $50 by 2020. By then, the efforts of Facebook, Google, OneWeb, and SpaceX to blanket the Earth with inexpensive Internet access through drones, balloons, and microsatellites will surely bear fruit. This means that we will see another three billion people come on line. Never before has all of humanity been connected in this way.This will be particularly transformative for the developing world. Knowledge has always been a privilege of the rich; tyrants rule by keeping their populations ignorant. Soon, everyone, everywhere, will have access to the ocean of knowledge on the Internet. They will be able to learn about scientific advances as they happen. Social media will enable billions of people to share their experiences and help one another. Workers in the remotest villages of Africa will be able to offer digital services to the elite in Silicon Valley. Farmers will be able learn how to improve crop yields; artisans will gain access to global markets; and economies based on smartphone apps will flourish everywhere.Doctors In Our PocketsAll of this has been made possible by advances in computing and networks. In a progression called Moore’s Law, computers continually get faster, cheaper, and smaller, doubling in speed every 18 months. Our $100 smartphones are more powerful than the supercomputers of the 1970s—which cost millions of dollars. With faster computers, it becomes possible to design more powerful sensors and artificial-intelligence (A.I.) systems. With better sensors, we can develop sophisticated medical devices, drone-based delivery systems, and smart cities; and, with A.I., we can develop self-driving cars, voice-recognition systems, and digital doctors. Yes, I am talking about applications that can diagnose our medical condition and prescribe remedies.In 2015, smartphone-connected medical devices came into the mainstream. Most notably, Apple released a watch that, using a heart-rate sensor and accelerometer, can keep track of vital signs, activity, and lifestyles. Through its free Research Kit app, Apple provided the ability to monitor, on a global scale, the use of medicines and their efficacy. Microsoft, IBM, Samsung, and Google too, as well as a host of startups, are developing sensors and A.I.-based tools to do the work of doctors. These technologies are expensive and geared for the developed world; but companies in China, India, and Africa are working on inexpensive versions. The sensors that these devices use, and the computing and storage that A.I. systems need cost very little. Previous generations of medical advances were for the rich; now all can benefit.Bitcoin And DisintermediationOne of the most controversial technology advances of late is Bitcoin, an unregulated and uncontrolled digital currency. It gained notoriety for its use by criminals and hackers and the fall of its price from a peak of about $1100 to $250. Yet, in 2015, it gained acceptance by retailers such as Overstock.com. And the technology that underlies it, blockchain, became the basis of hundreds of technology-development efforts.The blockchain is not useful just for finance. It is an almost incorruptible digital ledger that can be used to record practically anything that can be digitized: birth and death certificates, marriage licenses, deeds and titles of ownership, educational degrees, medical records, contracts, and votes. It has the potential to transform the lives of billions of people who lack bank accounts and access to the legal and administrative infrastructure that we take for granted.Engineering Of LifeAnother technology that came into the mainstream was CRISPR gene modification. Discovered by scientists only a few years ago, CRISPRs are elements of an ancient system that protects bacteria and other single-celled organisms from viruses, acquiring immunity to them by incorporating genetic elements from the virus invaders. Via CRISPRs, DNA can be edited, either removing unwanted sequences or inserting payload sequences, the genetic and chemical components necessary costing as little as $100.CRISPR modification introduces many new risks if used wrongly—to edit human embryos, for example. But it could also be used to correct faulty DNA that’s responsible for genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis, sickle-cell anemia, and Alzheimer’s, and to edit the genes of plants to produce more-nutritious food and require less water. Labs all over the world are working with this technology to solve a wide range of problems, and we will see breakthroughs.The Drone AgeAmericans will have purchased nearly half a million drones during this holiday season, according to some estimates. With the cost of these flying machines falling to less than $100, the drone age has officially begun. We will see them everywhere. As the technologies advance, these will carry increasing amounts of weight and travel over longer distances. You can expect Amazon and Walmart to deliver your groceries and Starbucks to bring you your morning latte via drone. And they will monitor traffic and crime, perform building inspections, and provide emergency assistance in disasters.These are an even bigger deal for the developing world. Large sections of Africa don’t have roads; remote towns and villages can’t get medical supplies; and large cities are clogged with traffic—much of it for delivery of small goods. Drones will solve many of these infrastructure problems and reduce pollution and traffic. They will also allow the constant monitoring of the Earth’s changing climate and wildlife ecology.Saving the planet with unlimited clean energyThe biggest geopolitical breakthrough in clean energy in 2015 wasn’t the climate agreement in Paris, between 196 countries, to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide. It was the deal that U.S. lawmakers struck to extend tax credits for solar and wind capture for another five years. The good intentions of nations will only take us so far; the U.S. deal will accelerate the progress of clean energy world wide.Solar and wind capture are already advancing on exponential curves, installation rates regularly doubling and costs falling. Even without the subsidies, the costs of U.S. solar installations could be halved by 2022, reducing the returns on investments in homes to less than four years. By, 2030, solar capture could provide 100 percent of today’s energy; by 2035, it could be free—just as cell-phone calls are today.The tax credits for renewable energy generation will accelerate and ensure progress. Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that the extension will add an extra 20 gigawatts of solar power—more than every panel ever installed in the U.S. prior to 2015. “The US was already one of the world’s biggest clean-energy investors. This deal is like adding another America of solar power into the mix,” Bloomberg said.We are also seeing similar advances in battery storage. Combined with the advances in energy, large swaths of the planet that don’t presently have electricity have the potential to light up in the early 2020s. Having unlimited, clean energy will be transformative for the developing world—and the planet.So we have a lot to be cheerful about and a lot to look forward to during the years ahead, as technology makes its major leaps forward. We just have to be careful to use it for bettering mankind rather than for holding it back—because there are as many risks as opportunities.In my next post, I will talk about what we can expect in 2016.']","[""About The AuthorJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'The term “financial inclusion” is a new buzzword in the fintech space. With the rise of services like Abra and MPesa, we are convinced that bitcoin is the solution to the problems of the unbanked. With bitcoin, we say, the house cleaner in Dubai can get her money home and the refugee can get his money over the border into a safer place.I’m even known to wax poetic about the topic. That’s fine. Optimism is a wonderful tonic for the soul. But we have entered a bubble made of cryptocurrency buzzwords and it’s important to assess what is going to happen over the next few years. In short, right now the bitcoin infrastructure is insufficient to support the unbanked. This must and will change.Before we begin, a bit of disclosure: I’ve been researching this for my own project, Freemit, and I’ve been talking to startups in this space. There are many differing views and I absolutely want the unbanked to receive the help they deserve. But it’s up to the entire industry to shift its practices to help the neediest.First, let’s discuss the unbanked in the US. Mehrsa Baradaran’s excellent book, How The Other Half Banks, tells of the fall of the rural bank and the growth of predatory and pernicious banking. During the early years of the banking industry, when the US was an agrarian society, each small town or community had its own bank. These multiple mini-banks served the community directly and were often the only place a farmer could get a loan before next year’s harvest. These mini-banks are what we think of when we imagine the nefarious landowner and banker in small town America – their whims could make or break a farm. The truth was that these small banks were the lifeblood of early America.Regulatory changes created nationwide banks that slowly subsumed the smaller banks. These tiny banks fell or were bought and the resulting banking deserts further gutted the agrarian towns and led to the growth of industrial America and its various discontents. You could now sell your soul to the company store and, further, deal with a faceless bank that had no connection to your local community. You could also get a large mortgage that let you buy a home in the suburbs and, barring the occasional horrible crash, that has been said to hold us all in good stead.Now, thanks to the hollowing out of bank branches, we have payday loans where a $600 loan can balloon to $2000 in fees and the only ATMs available feature a $3 fee. Once again, this is not always the case and this pessimistic view of the banking core but this same situation repeats itself in New York to Jakarta.But how do you solve this? Bitcoin will be the solution, but not until the entrenched players open connectors to the entire blockchain network – which, obviously, goes against the big banks special “internal blockchain” efforts. The banks still think that the blockchain is like the Internet – there should exist special private networks that only they can use “for security’s sake.” This is evocative of companies, back in 1999 or so, who wanted special VPNs for their companies so the big bad Internet – a catalyst for change that remade the world – wouldn’t interfere with their TPS reports.What the banks are really saying is they want to pull the jet engines off of the blockchain 747 but they don’t want to deal with all the smelly passengers and headstrong pilot. It’s folly that will soon be remedied.Still, this doesn’t solve the problems of the unbanked. Here are some pressing issues.The unbanked want to remain anonymous. A bank owner I spoke to noted that the primary problem in serving the unbanked is that they live in a cash economy. They want to remain anonymous for various reasons, be they immigration status, fear, or distrust of banks. The only way to solve this is to rewrite the onerous rules associated with closed networks like Western Union to allow the unbanked to use completely transparent networks. Regulations are scaring off money sending projects because they were written for a more barbaric age. This can only change but will take effort by the industry to move the perception that anonymous money sending is the tool of terrorists and drug dealers. By allowing $100 in cash to move anonymously you are helping a poor worker and not a gangster. The gangsters have their own ways to move money and $100 is a pittance.The unbanked live in places where predatory banking is more convenient. New School professor Lisa Servon said in a PBS story that “having quick access to their money is one big reason low-income people choose not to use traditional banks”“The South Bronx has only one bank per 20,000 residents,” she said. This means that check cashing and money changing spots, not to mention money sending kiosks that charge high rates, are the go to spots for transactions. New ideas like human ATMs are definitely interesting and work in places like Hong Kong where maids can visit a mall to send money home and where many small bitcoin remittance plays like are thriving.But these are small markets and not interesting to the big banks or big investors. Like, say, the Netscape browser in the early days of the Internet, these services are the small strange outliers that will eventually grow enormous.The unbanked are difficult to address. Acquiring unbanked customers that will trust your brand is difficult. That’s why the tools associated with Internet banking must first address the early adopter. The first mobile phones were found primarily inside expensive cars. Now they are found in every pocket around the world. This means the phone has moved from a tool for the rich (like bitcoin right now) to a tool for everyone.The first Internet shops required contacts at a hedge fund to start and hundreds of engineers to understand (like bitcoin). Anyone now can can use the tools created by that company to build anything they want. The barrier to building an Internet startup is basically an understanding of a little code. The same thing will happen in banking. As these apps become more usable the banking deserts will be no more since we will soon have a bank in our pocket that can do more than pay a few bills.GET IT HERE Shop ? What is this? Amazon Shop buttons are programmatically attached to our reviews. TechCrunch receives revenue for shopping activity generated by the links. Because the buttons are attached programmatically, they should not be interpreted as editorial endorsements.Smaller countries do not have bitcoin liquidity. As I’ve explored our own project, I’ve heard again and again of startups that failed because bitcoin is illiquid in the poorest countries. That’s why the best startups are sending phone minutes over borders or releasing debit cards that can be topped up remotely. These are alternative forms of value that can land in a country without proper infrastructure or access to cryptocurrenies and help people immediately. It will take a long time before the truly poor will even know about bitcoin and even then there is no reason to even discuss it. Instead it should be the sharpest sword in the arsenal of banking inclusion and fintech should work hard to ensure that the policies created now will help everyone, not just the rich.The bitcoin infrastructure is excellent, secure, and powerful in the abstract. In practice it is useless… but not for long. Fiat in and fiat out will become a real thing this year – hundreds of folks are working on the project – but to focus on the unbanked does nothing to interest big banks. They’ve already quite well ignored that subset of the world. I predict a number of exciting changes to this in the next year but it will take time for the true promise of bitcoin to express itself. When that happens we will see an engine of change that will rival the Internet in power and reach.', 'You can call Ledger Wallet CEO Eric Larchevêque the Winklevoss of France given that he stores around 1,000 bitcoins on his bitcoin wallet — that’s around $450,000 as of today. But it also shows how secure the company’s wallet is. I interviewed him on our stage at CES.Ledger Wallet’s first product was a sort of USB key that you would unlock using a PIN code. Now what happens if you lose it? Your bitcoins are safe as you need a private key to send these bitcoins. You can even recover your wallet and transfer your bitcoins to a new wallet.In other words, Ledger Wallet multiplies the number of factors to access your bitcoins, including a physical element. And even if your computer is infected, hackers can’t access your bitcoins as the most important part of the code is executed from the wallet directly.The company also showcased a new wallet, the Ledger Blue. It has a touch screen, supports USB, Bluetooth and NFC and uses the same kind of mechanisms as the company’s previous wallet.I also asked Larchevêque what he thought about the current climate around bitcoin. He’s still bullish but things it won’t become as ubiquitous as people previously expected. And he probably means what he says given how many bitcoins he personally owns.', 'Dolar byl proti Bitcoinu p?i vstupu do roku 2016 o 35 procent slabší než p?ed rokem.

01/23/2016,"['Because of Wuille’s view towards Dashjr’s proposal, an increasing number of bitcoin enthusiasts have begun to criticize Dashjr for purposely creating controversy in the Bitcoin community.With growing concerns regarding the Chinese miners’ “monopoly” over bitcoin hash power, influential Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr proposed a Proof of Work algorithm change on January 17, 2016.The Bitcoin network’s proof-of-work scheme is based on SHA-256, which was introduced by the creator of bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto as a part of the digital currency. Today, various cryptocurrency have adopted alternative hashing algorithms used for proof-of-work such as scrypt, Blake-256 and CryptoNight,Dashjr, posted a GitHub pull request titled “HARDFORK: Fix mining centralisation,” to receive support from the bitcoin community and possibly, from the supporters of Bitcoin Classic.However, Dashjr’s proposal was quickly shut down by Bitcoin Classic’s Jonathan Toomin, who stated, “If you think we should change the PoW function, going straight to Github is not the correct method. This is better discussed on Consider.it or reddit or something like that. I have unsubscribed from this thread. We will not be changing the PoW function in Classic.”Dashjr created a consider.it poll, to enable GPU mining for bitcoin enthuasiasts. The one-sided debate ended with agitated bitcoin experts and developers stating that Dashjr is purposely trying to upset the Chinese miners.“Decentralization is only partially determined by the geographic/political/logical distribution of nodes,” said Japanese mobile wallet Bittoku founder and president Jerry Chan.” Many people think they know what decentralization means but struggle to quantify it. The best proxy is the amount of money it would cost to subjugate the network. 1,000 scattered around the world with GPUs is drastically less secure than 10 companies running multi-million dollar businesses who depend on the network for income.Discussions Amongst Bitcoin DevelopersDuring the discussion between Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille and Dashjr on #bitcoin-dev, Wuille strongly opposed to the proposal of Dashjr, stating that such a change in Bitcoin Core would require an extremely high degree of consensus.“i would strongly oppose merging it in bitcoin core, on the grounds that it would require an extremely high degree of consensus, and i do not see that happening,” said Wuille.“As mining is an expensive choice for the ecosystem, and its only purpose is avoiding central control and censorship;; in a highly centralized mining ecosystem, you get the coss without the benefits. however, i think that it is clear right now that switching PoW would be way harder to get consensus on than other things that are being debated. So do not worry, i have no intention of merging such a thing,” he said.Because of Wuille’s view towards Dashjr’s proposal, an increasing number of bitcoin enthusiasts have begun to criticize Dashjr for purposely creating controversy in the Bitcoin community. However, Peter Todd emphasized that the statement of Dashjr was genuine and he truly believes a PoW change will reduce mining centralization.“He genuinely believes we should discuss this possibility, in part to remind miners that we’re all in this together and its much better for everyone if we continue to move forward with consensus. I agree with sipa that his statements may be politically inadvisable, but let’s not throw people under the bus for being bad at PR and politics,” said Todd.', 'Earlier this month, Ethereum Co-founder and CEO of Decentral & Kryptokit, Anthony Di Iorio began his new job at the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). “I\'m excited to take on this new role at one of Canada\'s top financial companies,"" he said at the time.The TSX’s parent company, TMX Group Limited, is headquartered in Toronto, with offices across Canada, key US markets, London, Beijing, Singapore and Sydney. The group is best known for its stock exchanges, such as the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), ranked the world\'s ninth largest by market capitalization in Jan 2015.The group serves emerging small cap and early stage companies, and helps them grow into “the blue-chips of the future.” The Group operates equities, fixed income, derivatives, and energy markets, generating US$717.3 million in revenue during 2014.“TMX Group is made up of an impressive portfolio of assets, capabilities and intellectual capital. As we prepare to enter the next crucial phase in our evolution, the job at hand is to determine how best to leverage all of our strengths and enable innovation across our business lines to create unique solutions for our clients that only TMX Group can provide.”- Louis V. Eccleston, TMX Group Limited Chief Executive OfficerWith a litany of impressive accomplishments, it is of little surprise that the TSX created a role specifically for him, Chief Digital Officer. Di Iorio started this new position hoping to help push Canada as a “top-tier player in financial tech and innovation,” and he will likely be working on any strategy around ""the conversion from analog to digital.""In early 2012, Di lorio became convinced that Bitcoin would make a major impact on the world’s financial markets, and decided to become active in the space and investing a large portion of his savings that year.He went on to launch the second Bitcoin ATM (BTM) in the world, and the first Bitaccess machine, in the hometown of the TSX, Toronto. How far things have come; Canada has coincidentally just launched installed a 100th BTM machine.He also began organizing Bitcoin and decentralized technology events that year, and has over 100 events under his belt to date, including many Ethereum conferences and the Bitcoin Expo series in Toronto.Among the events is the popular DEC_TECH (Decentralized Technologies) meetings, which Di Iorio hosts every quarter. He founded the meetup group in October 2012, there are more more than 1,200 members, including entrepreneurs, investors, startups, marketers, developers, and general enthusiasts of bitcoin and decentralized technologies of all types.It was at one such meeting, in the summer of 2012, that Di Iorio met business partner Vitalik Buterin, who shared with him the vision for Ethereum. This was over a year before the whitepaper was written.“The idea for a Turing complete Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform was devised by Vitalik while traveling around working on various projects in 2013 and realizing that adding features and building on top of Bitcoin was very limit beyond payments.”- Di IorioHe then founded the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, in early 2013. It remains a group dedicated to raising awareness of bitcoin among Canadian consumers, merchants, businesses, regulators, and policy makers. Soon afterward, he created and sold the gaming site Satoshi Circle.Di Iorio and Buterin then launched the first in-browser Bitcoin wallet, KryptoKit, all while he was still running various events. “I had brought in Vitalik as part of the Kryptokit in late 2013,” Di lorio explained.Around the same time, In December 2013, he co-founded Ethereum, a project that he was actively involved in until recently. “Over 50% of my portfolio is in Ether and Bitcoin,” Di Iorio divulged in a recent “Ask me Anything” session. “The Ether to Bitcoin split is about 40% / 60%.”“When [Vitalek] showed me the [Ethereum] white-paper in November 2013 I was hooked. I then passed it along to Charles Hoskinson and he joined the project. Mihai came in as he had also founded Bitcoin Magazine with Vitalik, and Amir C joined also as a founder as he had worked with Vitalik on Colored Coins. That was the original founding team.”- Di IorioAlthough smart contracts are an obvious tool for him to use in his new role at the TSX, Di Iorio mentioned that ""there are no plans at this time for TSX to be working with Ethereum.""Di Iorio started off 2014 by opening the decentralized tech hub Decentral, in Toronto. Decentral is a home to tech startups and innovative entrepreneurs focusing on disruptive and decentralized technologies. It has since spawned projects like Decentral.tv, a 24-hour interactive internet dashboard that acts like a TV station for Bitcoin market news. A second innovative wallet, and perhaps the most simple of all bitcoin wallets, Rushwallet, was also launched that year.A year ago, Di Iorio founded and became the CEO of Decentral Consulting Services, a technology consulting firm that specializes in blockchain and decentralized technologies. The firm works with Banks, Stock Exchanges and other enterprise businesses providing guidance on Blockchain technology. “For all our clients, we provide a professional gateway to the blockchain revolution,” said Di Iorio.Different business models may need different forms of a distributed ledger product, and Decentral is set up to help clients choose the right technology for their needs. However, between the different types of blockchains, Di Iorio sees powerful, open ledgers that can handle robust smart contracts, like Ethereum, eventually dominating the market.""I personally believe that permissioned blockchains have the most appeal to financial institutions. Regulations play a big part in that appeal. However, they are going to have to compete with open systems like Ethereum in the long term, and open will always win out in the end, in my opinion.""- Di IorioThe following month, Di Iorio became the Cryptocurrency Advisor to Fintech Cluster at the MaRS Discovery District, Canada’s first startup accelerator and dedicated financial technology hub, also in Toronto. In this role he connects the financial services sector with startups developing technology in emerging payments, peer-to-peer transactions, and alternative lending.Di Iorio also found time to lecture a Masters Degree program on Digital Currency, an online course offered by the largest university in Cyprus, the University of Nicosia. Available worldwide, the program “seeks to fill an important gap that exists today between the supply of and demand for academic knowledge in the area of digital currency.” The first course will be available next month a free Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), and is run by Bitcoin experts Andreas Antonopoulos and Antonis Polemitis.For those that may be concerned that his new role at the TSX will impact his many other businesses, Di Iorio offered some assurance: “Decentral and Kryptokit, along with the decentralized tech (DEC_TECH), Bitcoin, and Ethereum events we host at MaRS Discovery District and at our space will continue on as normal.""Di Iorio now has an office at the TSX, where he spends half of his time, but the number of hours varies, “I\'ve been averaging 35-40 there and about the same at Decentral.” The hours clearly add up, and while he works ”constantly,” he tries to keep regular hours, “from 4 am to 6 pm every day,” and he’s quick to credit the team, ""a well-oiled machine.""“We\'ve got a staff of 10 currently working at Decentral on various projects. Most of my time is spent directing the activities. The work is spread out between managing the ATM, Development of Ethereumwallet.com, the next line of wallets we\'re about to announce, and client work on the consulting side, and pushing out content and reports.”- Di IorioDi Iorio told Brave New Coin that he would like to see stronger merchant adoption, “more big companies accepting and promoting Bitcoin would be great. There seems to be a lull recently.” He states that big savings when using Bitcoin, or at least discounts, would also help drive adoption. “Purse.io is a great example. If only the masses would realize they could save +20% on everything at Amazon using Bitcoin. As a community we should be screaming this at the top of our lungs.”Bankers and financial institutions in Canada, he states, are eager to learn more about new technologies like distributed ledgers, and he isn’t worried about any “perceived opposition” from the sector. His personal goal in the new role is to “bring visibility to bitcoin and the blockchain within the Canadian finance markets.”', 'Cryptocurrency exchange CCEDK announced today that its Bitshares 2.0-based platform OpenLedger and a music streaming company PeerTracks have partnered with a new blockchain-based platform called MUSE to offer unique opportunities for monetising music.“The MUSE platform is a brand-new third-generation blockchain based on the Graphene Toolkit and specifically tailored to meet the music industry’s needs. It can be viewed as a membership organisation in the cloud that acts as a global database for copyright-related information.”Monetising music to fiat and cryptoMUSE suites for variety of music-related payments such as royalties, music sales, merchandise and concert ticket sales. Moreover, it is easy to use not just for cryptocurrency users but for anyone as OpenLedger offers a fiat gateway that allows consumers to buy music and artists to sell it for USD, or to be correct for crypto-USD. MUSE thereby permits global B2B, C2B and P2P transfers of value, bypassing the legacy banking system entirely if need be.Licensing music with smart contracts on the BlockchainMUSE allows the use of smart contracts capabilities to ensure music licensing using a distributed ledger. Thus, an artist can store basic copyright data about a song in the Blockchain. Moreover, they can input licensing conditions enforcing different fees for using a song as a soundtrack, in movies, TV commercials, etc.According to the official press release, users can also use the Automatic Royalty Payment Splitter to set down transparent rules to divide payments when they are received. It allows setting the way received payments will be divided between various individuals and labels depending on in which country the song was streamed.VIP-pass or fan club membership privileges tradeArtists can sell or give-away specially designed Tokens as a VIP-pass or fan club membership to their fans. These, limited in number, Tokens may work as discounts on merchandise, concert tickets or as backstage passes. The value of each Token can also vary and change depending on that artist’s popularity on PeerTracks.Cédric Cobban, President and Founder of PeerTracks explained this unique feature of the Tokens:“Everyone is excited about an instant and transparent royalty payment system coming into existence. They can all imagine it quite clearly with little to no explanation. The Token system on the other hand, although more difficult to grasp, allows for things that have never been done before. It translates to Crowdfunding, fan engagement, talent discovery and community building on scales we’ve never seen before.”Debit cards via OpenLedgerAnother upcoming feature is a CCEDK/OpenLedger/PeerTracks debit card that will allow any MUSE user to spend received crypto-USD anywhere a debit card is accepted.Ronny Boesing, CEO at CCEDK and OpenLedger said to CoinTelegraph:“The idea for future use is to have one card supporting numerous crypto coins like BTS, NuBits, DASH, DOGE and more including assets like MUSE and OBITS as well. It will then be possible choose a prepaid card or instant conversion to fiat card.”Ronny Boesing has also spent 25 years travelling the world to sell music before starting his cryptocurrency exchange CCEDK, that has released a new currency called OBITS at the end of 2015.He commented:“I’m thrilled to get back into this world after my years of experience in the business. There’s always been this urge to relive the excitement and thrill of being involved in this kind of work, and this is a fantastic way to combine my interests. The highlight of every year was the annual meet-up at the music festival in Cannes, and I see some great potential in taking active part of promoting all Muse-related activities at future events like this in Cannes and elsewhere.”Nevertheless, the new partnership and project bring another revenue stream to OBITS as well. Thus, this is not only a new opportunity for artists and music-lovers but also a support for the ongoing development of each of the projects.', 'Banks are going gaga for blockchain technology, the protocol developed to underpin bitcoin.It uses complex cryptography and a wide network of records — known as a ""distributed ledger"" — to eliminate the need for a central bank or middle man to regulate transactions.Banks have been swarming around the technology, with 42 investment banks signing up to an industry-wide group looking at how to use it and Goldman Sachs declaring in a note that it has the potential to change ""well, everything.""The conversation around this complex technology is pretty baffling, even to many of those involved. Everyone I speak to has a different way of describing it and the possibilities of what it could be used for are myriad.But Goldman has explained why banks are so excited, in its podcast on ""The Digitization of Finance."" Don Duet, co-head of the Technology Division at Goldman Sachs, nails it by describing not how blockchain works, but what it can do.Here what Duet says, as per an emailed transcript:You can see who had it, who owned it, the fact that they actually committed to each other electronically and signed it with cryptology to ensure that it was authorized. You could see all those things, and importantly, again, by having that all being done in a set of digital transactions, it enables it to happen in a much shorter time frame, so it also reduces a lot of what today are the delays which create other types of risk in the settlement cycles, which need to be compensated for in other forms.So one of the big benefits is pretty simple — transparency. At the moment, things like share registered are siloed in institutions so if you want to find out who owns what, you have to put a query to that institution.There are other problems too. Duet says:In order to facilitate the growth of our industry, much of that has been formed around concepts of having multiple sources or, you know, multiple parties owning a definition of truth, so the Bank of New York will own a big part of the reconciling of the ledger of who owns what stocks in the US, and so would other institutions around the world.But you end up where... you have this situation where you have multiple versions of the truth, which means that everyone needs to reconcile with each other to ensure that they all have the right set of information — who actually owns that asset, when did it get transferred — and it also creates a certain degree of just temporal delay. It’s not possible to be done right away.With the blockchain, that information is kept across multiple servers — the distributed ledger — all updated simultaneously and all you need to do is check out the blockchain. Much easier.So the blockchain can reduce admin errors, make things faster, reduces costs, and reduce settlement risk for things like payments and trading. It seems as close as a win-win as you\'re going to get.But Duet raises an interesting point in the podcast:I think that, you know, you could ask the question of, well, why couldn\'t this have been designed before? And I think that that’s a very valid question. I think part of what we find, or I certainly find personally very exciting about this is just the awareness. I think the awareness that’s happened within the financial community that there is a technological answer that can help drive change and improve our system is just very encouraging.Software is eating the world and it looks like it\'s finally eating finance.', 'Bitcoin zawiód??

Today, various cryptocurrency have adopted alternative hashing algorithms used for proof-of-work such as scrypt, Blake-256 and CryptoNight,Dashjr, posted a GitHub pull request titled “HARDFORK: Fix mining centralisation,” to receive support from the bitcoin community and possibly, from the supporters of Bitcoin Classic.However, Dashjr’s proposal was quickly shut down by Bitcoin Classic’s Jonathan Toomin, who stated, “If you think we should change the PoW function, going straight to Github is not the correct method. This is better discussed on Consider.it or reddit or something like that. I have unsubscribed from this thread. We will not be changing the PoW function in Classic.”Dashjr created a consider.it poll, to enable GPU mining for bitcoin enthuasiasts. The one-sided debate ended with agitated bitcoin experts and developers stating that Dashjr is purposely trying to upset the Chinese miners.“Decentralization is only partially determined by the geographic/political/logical distribution of nodes,” said Japanese mobile wallet Bittoku founder and president Jerry Chan.” Many people think they know what decentralization means but struggle to quantify it. The best proxy is the amount of money it would cost to subjugate the network. 1,000 scattered around the world with GPUs is drastically less secure than 10 companies running multi-million dollar businesses who depend on the network for income.Discussions Amongst Bitcoin DevelopersDuring the discussion between Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille and Dashjr on #bitcoin-dev, Wuille strongly opposed to the proposal of Dashjr, stating that such a change in Bitcoin Core would require an extremely high degree of consensus.“i would strongly oppose merging it in bitcoin core, on the grounds that it would require an extremely high degree of consensus, and i do not see that happening,” said Wuille.“As mining is an expensive choice for the ecosystem, and its only purpose is avoiding central control and censorship;; in a highly centralized mining ecosystem, you get the coss without the benefits. however, i think that it is clear right now that switching PoW would be way harder to get consensus on than other things that are being debated. So do not worry, i have no intention of merging such a thing,” he said.Because of Wuille’s view towards Dashjr’s proposal, an increasing number of bitcoin enthusiasts have begun to criticize Dashjr for purposely creating controversy in the Bitcoin community.

Thus, this is not only a new opportunity for artists and music-lovers but also a support for the ongoing development of each of the projects.', 'Banks are going gaga for blockchain technology, the protocol developed to underpin bitcoin.It uses complex cryptography and a wide network of records — known as a ""distributed ledger"" — to eliminate the need for a central bank or middle man to regulate transactions.Banks have been swarming around the technology, with 42 investment banks signing up to an industry-wide group looking at how to use it and Goldman Sachs declaring in a note that it has the potential to change ""well, everything.""The conversation around this complex technology is pretty baffling, even to many of those involved. Everyone I speak to has a different way of describing it and the possibilities of what it could be used for are myriad.But Goldman has explained why banks are so excited, in its podcast on ""The Digitization of Finance."" Don Duet, co-head of the Technology Division at Goldman Sachs, nails it by describing not how blockchain works, but what it can do.Here what Duet says, as per an emailed transcript:You can see who had it, who owned it, the fact that they actually committed to each other electronically and signed it with cryptology to ensure that it was authorized. You could see all those things, and importantly, again, by having that all being done in a set of digital transactions, it enables it to happen in a much shorter time frame, so it also reduces a lot of what today are the delays which create other types of risk in the settlement cycles, which need to be compensated for in other forms.So one of the big benefits is pretty simple — transparency. At the moment, things like share registered are siloed in institutions so if you want to find out who owns what, you have to put a query to that institution.There are other problems too. Duet says:In order to facilitate the growth of our industry, much of that has been formed around concepts of having multiple sources or, you know, multiple parties owning a definition of truth, so the Bank of New York will own a big part of the reconciling of the ledger of who owns what stocks in the US, and so would other institutions around the world.But you end up where... you have this situation where you have multiple versions of the truth, which means that everyone needs to reconcile with each other to ensure that they all have the right set of information — who actually owns that asset, when did it get transferred — and it also creates a certain degree of just temporal delay. It’s not possible to be done right away.With the blockchain, that information is kept across multiple servers — the distributed ledger — all updated simultaneously and all you need to do is check out the blockchain. Much easier.So the blockchain can reduce admin errors, make things faster, reduces costs, and reduce settlement risk for things like payments and trading. It seems as close as a win-win as you\'re going to get.But Duet raises an interesting point in the podcast:I think that, you know, you could ask the question of, well, why couldn\'t this have been designed before? And I think that that’s a very valid question. I think part of what we find, or I certainly find personally very exciting about this is just the awareness. I think the awareness that’s happened within the financial community that there is a technological answer that can help drive change and improve our system is just very encouraging.Software is eating the world and it looks like it\'s finally eating finance.', 'Bitcoin zawiód?? Ekspert twierdzi, ?e sie? by?a ""jeden krok od technicznego upadku""Zdaniem ekspertów, nad przysz?o?ci? cyfrowej waluty zbieraj? si? ciemne chmury.G?osuj G?osuj Podziel si? Opinie(Eastnews, Fot: Apaydin Alain/ABACA/EAST NEWS)Cena bitcoina w ubieg?ym tygodniu za?ama?a si? o 20 proc. To skutek mocnej wypowiedzi jednego z czo?owych deweloperów i kradzie?y 13 tys. bitcoinów z gie?dy Cryptsy. Kurs odbi? si? co prawda po informacji, ?e Bank of China pracuje nad w?asn? kryptowalut?, jednak zdaniem ekspertów, nad przysz?o?ci? bitcoina zbieraj? si? ciemne chmury.Mike Hearn z projektu Bitcoin Core napisa? na blogu, ?e sie? kryptowaluty by?a ""jeden krok od technicznego upadku"" z powodu braku porozumienia w jaki sposób j? rozwija?. U?ytkownicy bitcoina sugeruj?, ?e s?owa dewelopera mog? by? cz??ci? bankowej konspiracji.- Dlaczego bitcoin zawiód?? Zawiód? poniewa? zawiod?a spo?eczno??. Co? co mia?o by? now?, zdecentralizowan? form? pieni?dza, w której nie by?o systemowo wa?nych instytucji i by?o ""za du?e, ?eby upa??"" sta?o si? czym? ca?kowicie gorszym: systemem kontrolowanym przez garstk? ludzi - napisa? na blogu Hearn.Zobacz kurs bitcoina w dolarach od pocz?tku rokuJego zdaniem waluta b?dzie jeszcze przez jaki? czas zyskiwa?a na warto?ci do czasu, kiedy ca?kowicie popadnie w zapomnienie. Chodzi mu o brak porozumienia deweloperów w sprawie zwi?kszenia limitu wielko?ci bloku transakcji z obecnego 1MB. Deweloperzy podzielili si? w kwestii tego w jaki sposób zwi?kszy? limit, który przy narastaj?cej liczbie transakcji staje si? zbyt niski.Komentarz Hearna b?yskawicznie obieg? ?wiatowe media i przyczyni? si? do spadku kursu. Nied?ugo pó?niej pojawi?y si? teorie sugeruj?ce, ?e post, który zwróci? uwag? mediów mo?e by? reklam? jego nowej firmy R3CEV - skrytego startupu, pracuj?cego nad budow? technologii zdecentralizowanej ksi?gi w ponad 40 bankach, gdzie Hearn pracuje jako dyrektor platformy.Pod koniec 2015 roku deweloper postanowi? opu?ci? projekt Bitcoin, na rzecz nowej, du?o lepiej p?atnej pracy przy projekcie R3CEV. Komentarz Hearna pojawi? si? po spotkaniu grupy, które mia?o miejsce 14 stycznia i wzi??o w nim udzia? mi?dzy innymi o?miu cz?onków ameryka?skiej Rezerwy Federalnej. Ju? wtedy wiadomo by?o, ?e w ""New York Times"" znajdzie si? artyku? nieprzychylny dla bitcoina, dlatego jego u?ytkownicy zasugerowali, ?e tekst dewelopera mo?e by? cz??ci? strategii grupy.W swoim najnowszym tek?cie w portalu Medium.com Hearn odniós? si? do tych zarzutów, zauwa?aj?c ?e jego praca z R3 zosta?a ju? wcze?niej og?oszona i jego firma nie konkuruje z bitcoinem.- R3 nie jest firm? bitcoinow?, ani nawet firm? zwi?zan? z kryptowalutami, nie ma ?anego BankCoina ani R3Coina. Sprawa nie ma wi?c z nimi nic wspólnego, a teorie spiskowe s? tylko strat? czasu, kiedy s? teraz du?o powa?niejsze sprawy do rozwa?enia - twierdzi deweloper.Do sprawy odniós? si? tak?e wspó?za?o?yciel R3, Todd McDonald, podkre?li? on swoje przekonanie, ?e oba projekty mog? wspó?istnie?_ : - _Bitcoin konkuruje z niektórymi rzeczami, które robi? banki, ale du?? cz??ci? bankowo?ci stanowi? kredyty i handel. Dzia?ania te b?d? wci?? wyst?powa?, nawet w ?wiecie w którym bitcoin by?by jedn? globaln? walut?. To nie jest gra zero-jedynkowa. Banki i bitcoin wspó?egzystuj? i los R3 jest niezale?ny od bitcoina.']"

04/02/2016,"['Martin Hagelstrom is a bitcoin enthusiast and project executive and consultant working on IT projects at IBM.In this opinion piece, Hagelstrom analyzes CoinDesk articles from 2015 and 2016 to showcase the seismic shift in language used in the bitcoin and blockchain space and discusses how the community should react to this change.We all should know by now that 2016 will be blockchain\'s biggest year yet, and for good reason – financial incumbents are finding very clever ways to start investing and testing this technology without the fear of fueling what they perceive as a threat to their business models.The key to this transition has been the rebranding of distributed ledgers and digital currencies under the larger banner term ""blockchain"", a word that has become so common, it is suffering from a bit of fatigue.But the admittedly vague term, ""blockchain"", also comes without the bad publicity that still surrounds discussions of digital currencies, most notably bitcoin. And let’s be fair to the poor person who has to actually ask the board of directors for money. ""Anonymous"" and ""unregulated"" aren\'t the most popular concepts in highly regulated industries.However, this article is not about identifying the right approach to rebranding the industry; if private blockchains are secure or not; or whether they will really change the financial services business model.It\'s about how ""blockchain"" has become the most repeated word on the cryptocurrency world, even more than bitcoin, and about what we can do as a community once we accept this.A look at the numbersTo underscore this point, here\'s a word cloud generated by analyzing CoinDesk\'s articles published over the past month.As an experiment, I decided to drill down and analyzed all the articles where blockchain was part of the title this March and repeated this process for March 2015.Then, I found my first setback. No single article published on CoinDesk in March 2015 had blockchain in the title. The hottest FinTech technology of 2016 wasn\'t mentioned in a single headline a year ago.To move forward, I analyzed the articles where blockchain was mentioned in the text.Here are my results:20152016New observationsWe went from ""bitcoin"", ""network"", ""nodes"" and ""miners"" to ""blockchain"", ""technology"", ""smart contracts"" and ""applications"".The wording has definitely changed and it is because the reader has also changed. The crypto-world is not just for developers anymore – business people are getting involved, and they\'re changing the industry and its culture.These are the people that are more worried about the possible use cases than the technology itself. They don\'t really care how it works, as long it does. They care about what can be achieved with this new technology – efficiencies on business-to-business processes and new business models.But, how do we as a community best to respond to this data?My takeaway is that we need to attract the product guys to the mainstream. People buy TVs every day, and it is not because someone explains how they works. People buy TVs to watch their favorite shows or sports.Technology is a means to achieve a goal, and from the looks of this word analysis, financial incumbents are starting to get curious about what they might do with this new technology.Taking actionIn short, we need to forget about \'how the technology works\', and focus on \'what the technology does\'.We may all love the tech, but if we really want to attract the masses, we should focus on the use cases for those masses.Ask yourself how would to describe the Internet today?Are you thinking about TCP and package routing or are you using words like chatting, Facebooking and Skyping?Sure, the bitcoin community needs help from top marketers and creative professionals, but we can move the conversation forward as well by keeping this in mind and understanding our audience.Follow Martin Hagelstrom on Twitter.Comic book action words via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles. As such, the opinions expressed in this article are the author\'s own and do not necessarily reflect the view of CoinDesk.For more details on how you can submit an opinion or analysis article, view our Editorial Collaboration Guide or email news@coindesk.com.', 'CoinTelegraph investigates the pros and cons of storing one’s assets in Bitcoin versus storing them via traditional methods such as gold bullion, and speaks to a number of cryptocurrency experts to hear their view.Inherent valueOne of the biggest arguments against the cryptocurrency is that it has no inherent value, and as such cannot be considered a safe investment, as if people stop perceiving it as having value, your assets are lost, as it is not backed by anything in the same way that paper money is backed by state gold reserves.As Dominik ?ynis, President & CTO of Stealth Company, put it:“Gold is a store of value that goes back many thousands of years, while bitcoin is relatively new and still out to prove itself. Actually bitcoin is more like a specific kind of coin, whereas p2p consensus blockchains are more like gold the metal. What I am saying is bitcoin might be lead (the metal).”However, Patrick Dugan, CIO of Crypto Currency Concepts, suggests a different model: “I would argue that bitcoin the asset is like gold, and p2p cryptographic consensus is like physics. Gold\'s proof-of-work is all them supernovas what forged it!”Safe assetsFirstly, it\'s important for one to decide what they’re looking for in a means of asset storage. Do they want a stable rate of return, very low price volatility and by the same token, price stability, or very high returns that come with an increased chance of loss?Right now, if you’re looking for the first two, gold bullion or other precious metal storage is probably your best bet, with Bitcoin being the most favourable for the latter function. However, many in the Bitcoin community foresee Bitcoin becoming something of a ‘virtual gold’ as the price stabilises and becomes a solid means of stable asset storage.David Andolfatto of VP Fed Bank of St-Louis sees Bitcoin becoming the next safe asset, saying: “Is Bitcoin a safe asset? You\'re probably thinking no, of course not. The dollar price of bitcoin can be quite volatile. One can easily gain or lose 50% over a very short period of time. So if we\'re talking about an asset that offers a stable rate of return, Bitcoin ain\'t it.”However, he further elaborates:“Except that this is not what I mean by a safe asset. I\'m not even sure how to precisely define what I mean by safe asset. Loosely speaking, I\'m thinking about an asset that people flock to in bad or uncertain economic times. In normal times, it\'s an asset that is held despite having a relatively low rate of return, perhaps because of its use as a hedge, or because of its liquidity properties… I think that Bitcoin could be the world\'s next great safe asset. At least, it certainly seems to have all the properties that are desired in a safe asset.”The properties he is referencing include:Bitcoin constitute no legal claim against anything of intrinsic value, it is simply a record-keeping technology, meaning it is not pegged to any other monetary instrument’s value.It pays no interest, so can be stored for extensive periods of time.Possession corresponds to ownership, so confiscation by regulatory bodies is less of a risk.The ledger has proven itself secure, so Bitcoin is not at risk from traditional theft in the same way that gold and other precious metal bullion is.The money supply is fixed at 21 million BTC, so it will not devalue over time.He concludes by saying that even if Bitcoin is not a particularly ideal monetary instrument, this does not preclude it from serving as a safe asset or longer-term store of value. Once market penetration is complete, its return behavior is likely to mimic the return behavior of any other safe asset. Safe assets generally earn a low expected return (that is, they are priced dearly).Addressing to the investors, David Andolfatto says:“Investors can expect to earn unusually high returns in a crisis event. But if you buy at the top, you can expect to realize unusually high losses when the crisis subsides. In short, it\'s a great investment -- assuming you can predict when a crisis will occur and when it will end!”High risk, high returnFor those looking for an investment that is high risk, but high return, many would argue that Bitcoin is their best bet. As Rik Willard, CEO of MintCombine, suggests, if you want high returns on gold, it “needs to stay in the ground...to spur value,” something many miners, especially those looking to turn a quick profit in the business of illegal mining, are not prepared to do.Also on the topic of illegal gold mining, another reason for choosing Bitcoin over the traditional gold bullion is that you can be comfortable with the knowledge that your assets are not being stored in a means thats origin was potentially morally reprehensible.This comes as a new study has shown that water and food sources for 19 Indigenous Yanomami and Yekuana communities in the Brazilian Amazon contain dangerously high quantities of mercury as a result of illegal mining, which has led to researchers finding that 90% of people in these communities had been severely affected by mercury poisoning.Digital goldTone Vays of LibertyLifeTrail.com would argue that Bitcoin truly is ""Digital Gold"" but because it\'s so new there is significantly more price volatility risk which is a trade off vs. a much larger potential future valuation. While gold has been a store of value for thousands of year, gold does not adjust for technological innovation to improve standards of living and that is why the stock market has always outperformed gold in any 30-year time period.Another big problem with gold is that it has a huge political risk as authorities can confiscate it from any vault and as Gold Money recently found out, there is too much regulation preventing the creation of a gold-based payment system.Tone Vays explains to CoinTelegraph:“Gold is also no longer useful as a safe haven to transfer value cross-borders due to the invention of metal detectors and scanners. Both bitcoins and gold are difficult to protect when they are in your passion, but given the technological advancement, Bitcoin should start to become the obvious choice over the next 10 years as the better protective asset.”Uncertain futureAlex Matanovic, CEO of Serbian Bitcoin exchange, ecd.rs, also spoke to CoinTelegraph about the pros and cons of Bitcoin and gold bullion. He says that while gold is superior in being a store of value, Bitcoin is the investment choice for someone looking for profits. However, one must consider that Bitcoin may not be the consumer’s choice in the distant future.Alex Matanovic on why he prefers gold to bitcoin says:“Although I really love bitcoin, I would give a gold an edge when it comes to the ‘store of value’ function. We are talking about long-term investment and bitcoin is still very young, just over 7 years old, it needs to stand the test of time. That’s what gold has done better than anything else, being a reliable store of value for thousands of years.”At the end of the interview Matanovic points out that Bitcoin has been a better investment choice than gold for the most of the last 7 years. It might well keep being so in the years to come, but gold is definitely a safer bet.Matanovic on the future of bitcoin says:', 'Recent years have revealed a decline in major sports attendance due to how good the experience of watching at home now is. Bitcoin casinos are taking advantage of this same phenomenon to grow exponentially.Bitcoin is decentralized, mostly anonymous, and is not subject to variance in rules and regulations that traditional currency around the world is. For these reasons, it has become a popular way for people from around the globe to engage in gambling entertainment. It makes sense due to the cultural and religious stigma that is often associated with gambling. Making the trip to a brick and mortar casino or gaming on a traditional currency based online casino can be a hassle.Bitcoin allows for anonymous deposits and withdraws in a near instant fashion, making bitcoin gambling virtually anonymous. Further, bitcoin casino players can engage in their favorite games of chance or skill whenever they choose from the comfort of their own home. Hotels, transportation, and eating out costs are all eliminated.Sports Betting is also Experiencing Massive GrowthSports betting is another form of bitcoin gambling entertainment that has expanded at a frenetic rate, with vast potential to continue to grow. March Madness, the nickname for the tournament that decides the collegiate basketball championship in the United States, is expecting to take in more than 9 billion dollars’ worth of bets this year. Clearly the thirst for action from consumers is there and growing every single year. There are a large number of sports books who currently accept bitcoin deposits and bets.Sports and outcome betting junkies will also be excited to learn about bitcoin betting exchanges. Unlike traditional sports betting, where the house places the odds and the players can choose to either take those odds or not place a bet, bitcoin betting exchanges offer players a chance to play both sides.The betting exchanges work by supplying a venue for the action of players, who are able to place odds themselves or accept the odds of another player. Players bet against each other, the bitcoin betting exchange is simply a facilitator of the action. With this new freedom in action, players can either be the layer of odds or the backer of the bet. Both layers and backers can choose the odds they prefer, or create their own and allow other players to accept them if they wish.What makes this unique is bettors of both sides are able to place bets at odds they feel are most advantageous to them. This is not the only reason bitcoin betting exchanges should be on the radar of event occurrence betting enthusiasts, they will also save you a bundle on fees. Since bitcoin betting exchanges are not active participants in the bet, the fees associated with wagering there are dramatically lower than traditional sports books.Instead of the industry standard 5%-16%, bitcoin betting exchanges offer rates of around 2%. This is a huge equity gain for large and small players alike, giving everyone a better opportunity to be successful. If you have not yet looked into bitcoin betting exchanges, but enjoy the action of outcome based and sports wagering, now is definitely the time to do so.Fantasy sports betting is experiencing a prolonged growth spurt, becoming a multi-billion dollar industry in just a few short years. Just like with poker 5 years ago, state and federal regulators are cracking down with the exposure exponential growth has given fantasy sports betting. Many are frustrated with government involvement, suspecting it has more to do with the desire of traditional gambling outlets to protect their business than with the concern for customer safety.Calls for bitcoin to be integrated into the largest fantasy sports gambling sites have been ramping up on social media. Enthusiasts should pay close attention to the potential acceptance of bitcoin into their favorite fantasy sports gambling sites, as it is likely coming soon. Until then a large number of very reputable sites offer traditional sports betting based entirely on bitcoin, so no one is left without any options by their local regulations.Bitcoin Poker is Alleviating Frustration in the Online Poker WorldOnline Poker is not a new phenomenon, growing from a small community to over 50 million unique players participating in real money games in 2015. Also not new is the difficulty of depositing and withdrawing from online poker sites. Long brutally slow or even outlawed by national and local governments, traditional methods of withdrawing your money onto and off of poker sites have been a tedious process at best.Now many mainstream online poker sites are accepting bitcoin deposits and withdraws. Players can participate in big time online tournaments with up to a million dollar guarantee. Cash players can find steadily populated games from the micros all the way up to high stakes action.Research is Vital to a Satisfactory Bitcoin Gambling ExperienceDue to the large scale growth of bitcoin gambling casinos, bitcoin poker, and bitcoin sports books, researching where to play is now a must. Like any major industry, nefarious bitcoin gambling sites are out there looking to take advantage of unsuspecting players. In order to combat this players should be aware of the dangers and do their homework in terms of researching a site prior to depositing money there.First and foremost is ensuring that the site you are considering is using provably fair technology. Provably fair technology is now a bitcoin gambling standard and players should only trust sites that use it. The technology essentially eliminates the ability for either the bitcoin casino or the player to engage in any kind of cheating or exploitation. For a bet to be placed, it requires data from both the house and the player to be engaged. Once the bet is finished, it is publicly recorded with the outcome being something the player can verify immediately. This is a safeguard that every player should ensure the bitcoin gambling site they choose to wager uses.Secondly, bitcoin forums and bitcoin casino review sites are an invaluable tool for players. Bitcoin gambling forums can give players a first-hand account of their experience, good or bad, with bitcoin gambling sites. This allows for players to make an informed decision based on how other players felt about their play on certain sites. Review sites are excellent sources of information about the specifics of each bitcoin casino, as well as a guide to where to find the best promotions and player deals to take advantage of.', 'De Telecommunicatiewet verplicht FD Mediagroep om bezoekers van haar websites te informeren over cookies en uw toestemming te vragen voor het gebruik van deze cookies.FD Mediagroep maakt gebruik van cookies om de website FD.nl goed te laten functioneren en het gebruik van de website te analyseren en te kunnen verbeteren.Met uw toestemming verzamelen FD Mediagroep en derde partijen via cookies informatie over uw bezoek aan FD.nl en uw persoonlijke interesses, onder meer om het nieuws voor u te personaliseren en advertenties aan te passen aan uw interesses.

Both bitcoins and gold are difficult to protect when they are in your passion, but given the technological advancement, Bitcoin should start to become the obvious choice over the next 10 years as the better protective asset.”Uncertain futureAlex Matanovic, CEO of Serbian Bitcoin exchange, ecd.rs, also spoke to CoinTelegraph about the pros and cons of Bitcoin and gold bullion. He says that while gold is superior in being a store of value, Bitcoin is the investment choice for someone looking for profits. However, one must consider that Bitcoin may not be the consumer’s choice in the distant future.Alex Matanovic on why he prefers gold to bitcoin says:“Although I really love bitcoin, I would give a gold an edge when it comes to the ‘store of value’ function. We are talking about long-term investment and bitcoin is still very young, just over 7 years old, it needs to stand the test of time. That’s what gold has done better than anything else, being a reliable store of value for thousands of years.”At the end of the interview Matanovic points out that Bitcoin has been a better investment choice than gold for the most of the last 7 years. It might well keep being so in the years to come, but gold is definitely a safer bet.Matanovic on the future of bitcoin says:', 'Recent years have revealed a decline in major sports attendance due to how good the experience of watching at home now is. Bitcoin casinos are taking advantage of this same phenomenon to grow exponentially.Bitcoin is decentralized, mostly anonymous, and is not subject to variance in rules and regulations that traditional currency around the world is. For these reasons, it has become a popular way for people from around the globe to engage in gambling entertainment. It makes sense due to the cultural and religious stigma that is often associated with gambling. Making the trip to a brick and mortar casino or gaming on a traditional currency based online casino can be a hassle.Bitcoin allows for anonymous deposits and withdraws in a near instant fashion, making bitcoin gambling virtually anonymous. Further, bitcoin casino players can engage in their favorite games of chance or skill whenever they choose from the comfort of their own home. Hotels, transportation, and eating out costs are all eliminated.Sports Betting is also Experiencing Massive GrowthSports betting is another form of bitcoin gambling entertainment that has expanded at a frenetic rate, with vast potential to continue to grow. March Madness, the nickname for the tournament that decides the collegiate basketball championship in the United States, is expecting to take in more than 9 billion dollars’ worth of bets this year. Clearly the thirst for action from consumers is there and growing every single year. There are a large number of sports books who currently accept bitcoin deposits and bets.Sports and outcome betting junkies will also be excited to learn about bitcoin betting exchanges. Unlike traditional sports betting, where the house places the odds and the players can choose to either take those odds or not place a bet, bitcoin betting exchanges offer players a chance to play both sides.The betting exchanges work by supplying a venue for the action of players, who are able to place odds themselves or accept the odds of another player. Players bet against each other, the bitcoin betting exchange is simply a facilitator of the action. With this new freedom in action, players can either be the layer of odds or the backer of the bet. Both layers and backers can choose the odds they prefer, or create their own and allow other players to accept them if they wish.What makes this unique is bettors of both sides are able to place bets at odds they feel are most advantageous to them. This is not the only reason bitcoin betting exchanges should be on the radar of event occurrence betting enthusiasts, they will also save you a bundle on fees. Since bitcoin betting exchanges are not active participants in the bet, the fees associated with wagering there are dramatically lower than traditional sports books.Instead of the industry standard 5%-16%, bitcoin betting exchanges offer rates of around 2%. This is a huge equity gain for large and small players alike, giving everyone a better opportunity to be successful. If you have not yet looked into bitcoin betting exchanges, but enjoy the action of outcome based and sports wagering, now is definitely the time to do so.Fantasy sports betting is experiencing a prolonged growth spurt, becoming a multi-billion dollar industry in just a few short years. Just like with poker 5 years ago, state and federal regulators are cracking down with the exposure exponential growth has given fantasy sports betting. Many are frustrated with government involvement, suspecting it has more to do with the desire of traditional gambling outlets to protect their business than with the concern for customer safety.Calls for bitcoin to be integrated into the largest fantasy sports gambling sites have been ramping up on social media. Enthusiasts should pay close attention to the potential acceptance of bitcoin into their favorite fantasy sports gambling sites, as it is likely coming soon. Until then a large number of very reputable sites offer traditional sports betting based entirely on bitcoin, so no one is left without any options by their local regulations.Bitcoin Poker is Alleviating Frustration in the Online Poker WorldOnline Poker is not a new phenomenon, growing from a small community to over 50 million unique players participating in real money games in 2015. Also not new is the difficulty of depositing and withdrawing from online poker sites. Long brutally slow or even outlawed by national and local governments, traditional methods of withdrawing your money onto and off of poker sites have been a tedious process at best.Now many mainstream online poker sites are accepting bitcoin deposits and withdraws. Players can participate in big time online tournaments with up to a million dollar guarantee. Cash players can find steadily populated games from the micros all the way up to high stakes action.Research is Vital to a Satisfactory Bitcoin Gambling ExperienceDue to the large scale growth of bitcoin gambling casinos, bitcoin poker, and bitcoin sports books, researching where to play is now a must. Like any major industry, nefarious bitcoin gambling sites are out there looking to take advantage of unsuspecting players. In order to combat this players should be aware of the dangers and do their homework in terms of researching a site prior to depositing money there.First and foremost is ensuring that the site you are considering is using provably fair technology. Provably fair technology is now a bitcoin gambling standard and players should only trust sites that use it. The technology essentially eliminates the ability for either the bitcoin casino or the player to engage in any kind of cheating or exploitation. For a bet to be placed, it requires data from both the house and the player to be engaged. Once the bet is finished, it is publicly recorded with the outcome being something the player can verify immediately. This is a safeguard that every player should ensure the bitcoin gambling site they choose to wager uses.Secondly, bitcoin forums and bitcoin casino review sites are an invaluable tool for players. Bitcoin gambling forums can give players a first-hand account of their experience, good or bad, with bitcoin gambling sites. This allows for players to make an informed decision based on how other players felt about their play on certain sites. Review sites are excellent sources of information about the specifics of each bitcoin casino, as well as a guide to where to find the best promotions and player deals to take advantage of.', 'De Telecommunicatiewet verplicht FD Mediagroep om bezoekers van haar websites te informeren over cookies en uw toestemming te vragen voor het gebruik van deze cookies.FD Mediagroep maakt gebruik van cookies om de website FD.nl goed te laten functioneren en het gebruik van de website te analyseren en te kunnen verbeteren.Met uw toestemming verzamelen FD Mediagroep en derde partijen via cookies informatie over uw bezoek aan FD.nl en uw persoonlijke interesses, onder meer om het nieuws voor u te personaliseren en advertenties aan te passen aan uw interesses.

The majority of ransomware infections require victims to pay a fee in Bitcoin, and a lot of people have trouble with obtaining cryptocurrency. A service desk for victims has been created by the developers of CryptoWall and Cryptolocker to make this process a bit easier.

But there are some benefits to the criminals as well, as they can increase the payment rate for their victims.While it is incredibly annoying to deal with ransomware, the last thing most people expected was to get help from the assailants themselves. However, given this lucrative business model, it only makes sense the distributors want to make as much money as possible. If that means guiding people through the process of paying the ransom, so be it. In fact, one developer has added call center support, where victims can call to and get aid in paying the fee.But there is more, as mouth-to-mouth marketing as to how assailants helped their victims will have a mental effect as well. Even if somebody pays the ransom in Bitcoin, there is no guarantee the hackers will send them the decryption key. This way, they can ensure they have somewhat of a decent reputation in the ransomware world.It is a very strange business model, to say the least, but it does not come as a complete surprise either. Internet criminals see the value in spreading ransomware, but if no one is paying, there is no point in pursuing this business. As odd as that may sound, spreading ransomware is a business model like any other, albeit it is a very wrong and illegal one.In the end, users still need to take every possible precaution to ensure they will not become the victim of a ransomware attack.

The pilot app makes Santander the first U.K. bank to use Ripple technology for cross-border payments.Santander is introducing the app as a staff pilot, with the intention to expand the technology.Once the app is downloaded, Santander staff just have to complete profile details to start to make payments. The app connects to Apple Pay, where users can securely confirm payments using Touch ID. It allows users transfer between £10 and £10,000. Payments can be made from GBP to EUR and USD. Payments made in EUR can go to 21 countries while U.S. dollar payments can only go to the United States.Ripple is providing the technology for the app.Santander Shows Leadership“Leading banks like Santander are taking advantage of our enterprise blockchain solutions to improve their cross-border payments, drastically reducing the time and cost of settlement and enabling new types of high volume, low-value global transactions,” noted Monica Long on Ripple’s website.The need for finance has expanded from providing a physical pound to being seamlessly integrated into a connected lifestyle, said Sigga Sigurdardottir, Santander’s head of innovation.Santander Seeks ProgressSantander is working to ensure its banking is fair, personal and simple, Sigurdardottir said, and it views blockchain technology as playing a transformative role in how it achieves its goals to better serve customers by adding value from creating more convenience and choice.“Ripple is redefining the way that value moves around the world, and today we’re already enabling real-time, affordable international settlement between banks who have adopted our solutions,” said Chris Larsen, Ripple CEO and co-founder.Larsen said Santander is the first bank in the world to transfer real funds externally, and that in doing so, they are creating a new service standard.Security and regulatory compliance is key to all of Santander’s activity, Ripple noted, and the app has already undergone the testing needed for a rollout.Santander Invests In RippleSantander InnoVentures – Santander Group’s $100 million fintech venture capital fund –joined Ripple’s Series A funding round as an investor, bringing the round’s total to $32 million in October.Ripple’s Series A funding round included a mix of investment firms and global strategic investors that support Ripple’s vision to enable an Internet of Value by supporting the secure, real-time, settlement of funds for financial institutions and their customers globally.“Santander InnoVentures is a natural fit in this round because of their demonstrated support for real-time international payments and their commitment to new technologies that enable Santander to empower its customers,” Larsen said at the time. “We are excited to work closely with them in building the Internet of Value and accelerating adoption amongst financial institutions, market makers and businesses worldwide.”Also read: Ripple Labs CEO: Partnership with banking block chain consortium R3 in the offingBelinky Praises RippleMariano Belinky, managing partner of Santander InnoVentures, said the bank has long advocated modernizing banking infrastructure. In its Fintech 2.0 report, Santander highlighted a $20 billion opportunity for the financial services industry where distributed ledger technology will have a positive impact.Belinky said Ripple has the technology, talent, and momentum to address many such scenarios, and is exploring how best to apply Ripple technology in the bank. “Ripple and Santander share a common vision of the future of the industry, and we intend to jointly advocate it in the community,” Belinky said.Featured image from Shutterstock and LinkedIn.Advertisement:', 'Bitcoin jako sou?ást pokladny s EET? Jde to!Babiš a bitcoinTagy: Bitcoin, Kryptom?na, EETMyslíte, že bitcoin m?že být sou?ástí platebního systému, pln? p?ipraveného pro elektronickou evidenci tržeb (EET)? Jde to. Jak by to celé mohlo fungovat lze vyzkoušet na první bitcoinové pokladn? p?ipravené pro elektronickou evidenci tržeb – LILKA. Jedná se o pokladní systém s EET pro každý tablet, chytrý telefon, nebo jakýkoliv po?íta?, napsal server btctip.cz.LILKA eviduje položky p?i prodeji a poskytuje kompletní p?ehledy tržeb a pokladních operací pro ú?etní a skladové systémy. Modul p?ijímání plateb bitcoiny umož?uje p?ímou konverzi platby bitcoinem do národní m?ny obchodníka a odeslání na bankovní ú?et obchodníka, nebo do jeho bitcoinové pen?ženky.LILKA také umož?uje nasazení pokladního systému do samostatné pokladní jednotky, a to bez dodate?ných investic. Pokud není její sou?ástí tiskárna pro tisk ú?tenek, bude ji samoz?ejm? nutné po?ídit, jakmile bude nasazena EET do ostrého provozu. LILKA je na elektronickou evidenci tržeb pln? p?ipravena a již nyní si ji m?žete vyzkoušet v testovacím režimu.Platby bitcoinem jsou umožn?ny díky integraci platební brány Bitcoinpay API do LILKY. Díky tomu m?že bitcoin akceptovat každý obchodník, který si tento pokladní systém po?ídí. Dá se o?ekávat, že poptávka po pokladních systémech bude v následujících m?sících a letech vzr?stat, stejn? jako po?et obchodník?, pro které bude akceptace bitcoinu b?žnou formou úhrady.Elektronická evidence tržeb by m?la být v první fázi spušt?na od 1. prosince pro hotely a restaurace. Další firmy se budou do EET zapojovat v následujících m?sících. Od b?ezna p?íštího roku budou muset evidovat tržby maloobchodní a velkoobchodní firmy. Od 16. m?síce od ú?innosti mají být evidovány všechny tržby krom? tržeb ?emeslník?, které se pod zákon dostanou od 18. m?síce. Vláda bude moci na?ízením stanovit, že n?které tržby nebudou od nabytí ú?innosti zákona do?asn? evidovanými tržbami.Jakmile bude do?ešena aktuáln? vyhrocená válka o velikost blok? a najde se optimální ?ešení, bude bitcoinová sí? schopna zvládnout v?tší objem transakcí. To by ji v budoucnu mohlo umožnit p?iblížit se podobnému objemu transakcí, které dokáže za vte?inu zpracovat Visa a Mastercard. Otázkou je, zda to lze v?bec srovnávat, protože bitcoinová sm?nárna nebo platební procesor p?i správném nastavení také dokáží za vte?inu zpracovat i n?kolik tisíc operací.Pokud ale budeme brát p?enos platby bitcoinem jako vým?nu pen?z mezi dv?ma entitami a srovnáme tento proces s bankami, kde i tuzemský p?evod trvá b?žn? jeden den, je bitcoin už nyní tím nejrychlejším clearingovým nástrojem na sv?t?, kdy transakce zabere s první konfirmací zhruba deset minut.Jaroslav Pr?chaŠéfredaktor', 'Der rasante Höhenflug des Bitcoin Kurses nimmt kein Ende: Nachdem in den vergangenen 48 Stunden bereits starke Kursanstiege zu erkennen waren und der Bitcoin mit ca. 430 Euro am 27.05 bereits seinen Höchstand 2016 geknackt. In der Nacht von Samstag auf Sonntag schießt er erneut in die Höhe.Bitcoin Kurs über 450 EuroGegen 22 Uhr am Samstagabend begann der Bitcoin Kurs anzusteigen, nachdem er sich seit 10 Uhr am Morgen relativ gleichmäßig an der magischen 500$ Marke gehalten hatte. Der Anstieg des Vortags war lief bis in die Morgenstunden des Samstags und zog eine Stabilisierung nach sich.Kursanstieg in den AbendstundenErst gegen 22:20 am Samstag wurde die 500$ Marke überschritten und markierte damit den Durchbruch nach oben. Nur eine Stunde später (ca. 23:20) erreichte der Bitcoin ein Level von 515$ im Coindesk BPI. Eine gute weitere Stunde verging bis Mitternacht und dem nächsten großen Anstieg. Bis 00:35 Uhr stieg er auf sein bisheriges Höchstniveau von 530US-Dollar und erreichte auf deutschsprachigen Marktplätzen wie Anycoin Direct Handelspreise von ca. 450 Euro (zum Vergleich: In den vergangenen Wochen hatte der Bitcoin sich ziemlich stabil an der 400€ Marke festgehalten).Quelle: coindesk.comUm knapp 12,5% hat der Bitcoin somit innerhalb kürzester Zeit zugelegt.Ursachen für den KursanstiegWie BTC-Echo bereits am Samstag vermutet hatte, gab es ein Umschwenken unter Tradern, dass eine größere Welle an Bitcoin Käufen ausgelöst haben könnte.Hinzu kommt die Geldpolitik in China: Eine Abwertung der Währung könnte Ursache für viele Käufe von Bitcoins gewesen sein. Wie marketwatch.com berichtet, wurde der sogenannte Yuan-Fix (Umtauschwert von Dollar in Yuan) auf 6.5693 gesetzt. Das ist der tiefste Wert seit über fünf Jahren, heißt es weiter.Aus diesem Grund lassen sich auch Spekulationen anstellen, ob die politischen Einflüsse in China viele Bitcoin Nutzer dazu geführt haben, ihr Vermögen vor der Inflation zu schützen und alternative (digitale) Währungen wie den Bitcoin stärker zu nutzen.Meinung des Autors(Max):Eine Kursanalyse ist gerade deshalb spannend, weil es zum Zeitpunkt des Geschehens keine “richtige” Antwort gibt: Letztendlich lässt sich nur auf finanzieller, politischer oder markttechnischer Ebene spekulieren, welche Aktionen für den rasanten Kursanstieg verantwortlich sind. So wird der wirkliche Grund auch in diesem Fall erst nach den Turbulnzen bekannt werden. Der Zusammenhang mit der Währungsabwertung in China ist dennoch ein realistisches Szenario. In Betracht könnte auch das anstehende Block Halving kommen, dessen Zeitpunkt auf den 10. Juli (ca. 40 Tage) geschätzt wird. Vielleicht haben wir es heute auch einfach mit einer Kombination vieler aufeinandertreffender Faktoren zu tun.BTC-EchoÜber Max Kops Maximilian Kops arbeitet als Analyst und Autor für BTC-ECHO und ist spezialisiert auf Fragen zur technischen Entwicklung von Blockchains als auch zu FinTech-Startups.

Even if somebody pays the ransom in Bitcoin, there is no guarantee the hackers will send them the decryption key. This way, they can ensure they have somewhat of a decent reputation in the ransomware world.It is a very strange business model, to say the least, but it does not come as a complete surprise either. Internet criminals see the value in spreading ransomware, but if no one is paying, there is no point in pursuing this business. As odd as that may sound, spreading ransomware is a business model like any other, albeit it is a very wrong and illegal one.In the end, users still need to take every possible precaution to ensure they will not become the victim of a ransomware attack. Keeping the OS and antivirus solutions up-to-date is only part of the solution. Never click on unknown links, and do not open email attachments from untrusted sources. Last but not least, always make a backup of the important files on your device.Source: FinextraHeader image courtesy of NewsBTC', 'Santander has begun using an app for international payments using Ripple Labs’ blockchain technology, according to Ripple on its Ripple Insights website. The pilot app makes Santander the first U.K. bank to use Ripple technology for cross-border payments.Santander is introducing the app as a staff pilot, with the intention to expand the technology.Once the app is downloaded, Santander staff just have to complete profile details to start to make payments. The app connects to Apple Pay, where users can securely confirm payments using Touch ID. It allows users transfer between £10 and £10,000. Payments can be made from GBP to EUR and USD. Payments made in EUR can go to 21 countries while U.S. dollar payments can only go to the United States.Ripple is providing the technology for the app.Santander Shows Leadership“Leading banks like Santander are taking advantage of our enterprise blockchain solutions to improve their cross-border payments, drastically reducing the time and cost of settlement and enabling new types of high volume, low-value global transactions,” noted Monica Long on Ripple’s website.The need for finance has expanded from providing a physical pound to being seamlessly integrated into a connected lifestyle, said Sigga Sigurdardottir, Santander’s head of innovation.Santander Seeks ProgressSantander is working to ensure its banking is fair, personal and simple, Sigurdardottir said, and it views blockchain technology as playing a transformative role in how it achieves its goals to better serve customers by adding value from creating more convenience and choice.“Ripple is redefining the way that value moves around the world, and today we’re already enabling real-time, affordable international settlement between banks who have adopted our solutions,” said Chris Larsen, Ripple CEO and co-founder.Larsen said Santander is the first bank in the world to transfer real funds externally, and that in doing so, they are creating a new service standard.Security and regulatory compliance is key to all of Santander’s activity, Ripple noted, and the app has already undergone the testing needed for a rollout.Santander Invests In RippleSantander InnoVentures – Santander Group’s $100 million fintech venture capital fund –joined Ripple’s Series A funding round as an investor, bringing the round’s total to $32 million in October.Ripple’s Series A funding round included a mix of investment firms and global strategic investors that support Ripple’s vision to enable an Internet of Value by supporting the secure, real-time, settlement of funds for financial institutions and their customers globally.“Santander InnoVentures is a natural fit in this round because of their demonstrated support for real-time international payments and their commitment to new technologies that enable Santander to empower its customers,” Larsen said at the time. “We are excited to work closely with them in building the Internet of Value and accelerating adoption amongst financial institutions, market makers and businesses worldwide.”Also read: Ripple Labs CEO: Partnership with banking block chain consortium R3 in the offingBelinky Praises RippleMariano Belinky, managing partner of Santander InnoVentures, said the bank has long advocated modernizing banking infrastructure. In its Fintech 2.0 report, Santander highlighted a $20 billion opportunity for the financial services industry where distributed ledger technology will have a positive impact.Belinky said Ripple has the technology, talent, and momentum to address many such scenarios, and is exploring how best to apply Ripple technology in the bank. “Ripple and Santander share a common vision of the future of the industry, and we intend to jointly advocate it in the community,” Belinky said.Featured image from Shutterstock and LinkedIn.Advertisement:', 'Bitcoin jako sou?ást pokladny s EET? Jde to!Babiš a bitcoinTagy: Bitcoin, Kryptom?na, EETMyslíte, že bitcoin m?že být sou?ástí platebního systému, pln? p?ipraveného pro elektronickou evidenci tržeb (EET)? Jde to. Jak by to celé mohlo fungovat lze vyzkoušet na první bitcoinové pokladn? p?ipravené pro elektronickou evidenci tržeb – LILKA. Jedná se o pokladní systém s EET pro každý tablet, chytrý telefon, nebo jakýkoliv po?íta?, napsal server btctip.cz.LILKA eviduje položky p?i prodeji a poskytuje kompletní p?ehledy tržeb a pokladních operací pro ú?etní a skladové systémy. Modul p?ijímání plateb bitcoiny umož?uje p?ímou konverzi platby bitcoinem do národní m?ny obchodníka a odeslání na bankovní ú?et obchodníka, nebo do jeho bitcoinové pen?ženky.LILKA také umož?uje nasazení pokladního systému do samostatné pokladní jednotky, a to bez dodate?ných investic. Pokud není její sou?ástí tiskárna pro tisk ú?tenek, bude ji samoz?ejm? nutné po?ídit, jakmile bude nasazena EET do ostrého provozu. LILKA je na elektronickou evidenci tržeb pln? p?ipravena a již nyní si ji m?žete vyzkoušet v testovacím režimu.Platby bitcoinem jsou umožn?ny díky integraci platební brány Bitcoinpay API do LILKY. Díky tomu m?že bitcoin akceptovat každý obchodník, který si tento pokladní systém po?ídí. Dá se o?ekávat, že poptávka po pokladních systémech bude v následujících m?sících a letech vzr?stat, stejn? jako po?et obchodník?, pro které bude akceptace bitcoinu b?žnou formou úhrady.Elektronická evidence tržeb by m?la být v první fázi spušt?na od 1. prosince pro hotely a restaurace. Další firmy se budou do EET zapojovat v následujících m?sících. Od b?ezna p?íštího roku budou muset evidovat tržby maloobchodní a velkoobchodní firmy. Od 16. m?síce od ú?innosti mají být evidovány všechny tržby krom? tržeb ?emeslník?, které se pod zákon dostanou od 18. m?síce. Vláda bude moci na?ízením stanovit, že n?které tržby nebudou od nabytí ú?innosti zákona do?asn? evidovanými tržbami.Jakmile bude do?ešena aktuáln? vyhrocená válka o velikost blok? a najde se optimální ?ešení, bude bitcoinová sí? schopna zvládnout v?tší objem transakcí. To by ji v budoucnu mohlo umožnit p?iblížit se podobnému objemu transakcí, které dokáže za vte?inu zpracovat Visa a Mastercard. Otázkou je, zda to lze v?bec srovnávat, protože bitcoinová sm?nárna nebo platební procesor p?i správném nastavení také dokáží za vte?inu zpracovat i n?kolik tisíc operací.Pokud ale budeme brát p?enos platby bitcoinem jako vým?nu pen?z mezi dv?ma entitami a srovnáme tento proces s bankami, kde i tuzemský p?evod trvá b?žn? jeden den, je bitcoin už nyní tím nejrychlejším clearingovým nástrojem na sv?t?, kdy transakce zabere s první konfirmací zhruba deset minut.Jaroslav Pr?chaŠéfredaktor', 'Der rasante Höhenflug des Bitcoin Kurses nimmt kein Ende: Nachdem in den vergangenen 48 Stunden bereits starke Kursanstiege zu erkennen waren und der Bitcoin mit ca. 430 Euro am 27.05 bereits seinen Höchstand 2016 geknackt. In der Nacht von Samstag auf Sonntag schießt er erneut in die Höhe.Bitcoin Kurs über 450 EuroGegen 22 Uhr am Samstagabend begann der Bitcoin Kurs anzusteigen, nachdem er sich seit 10 Uhr am Morgen relativ gleichmäßig an der magischen 500$ Marke gehalten hatte. Der Anstieg des Vortags war lief bis in die Morgenstunden des Samstags und zog eine Stabilisierung nach sich.Kursanstieg in den AbendstundenErst gegen 22:20 am Samstag wurde die 500$ Marke überschritten und markierte damit den Durchbruch nach oben. Nur eine Stunde später (ca. 23:20) erreichte der Bitcoin ein Level von 515$ im Coindesk BPI. Eine gute weitere Stunde verging bis Mitternacht und dem nächsten großen Anstieg. Bis 00:35 Uhr stieg er auf sein bisheriges Höchstniveau von 530US-Dollar und erreichte auf deutschsprachigen Marktplätzen wie Anycoin Direct Handelspreise von ca. 450 Euro (zum Vergleich: In den vergangenen Wochen hatte der Bitcoin sich ziemlich stabil an der 400€ Marke festgehalten).Quelle: coindesk.comUm knapp 12,5% hat der Bitcoin somit innerhalb kürzester Zeit zugelegt.Ursachen für den KursanstiegWie BTC-Echo bereits am Samstag vermutet hatte, gab es ein Umschwenken unter Tradern, dass eine größere Welle an Bitcoin Käufen ausgelöst haben könnte.Hinzu kommt die Geldpolitik in China: Eine Abwertung der Währung könnte Ursache für viele Käufe von Bitcoins gewesen sein. Wie marketwatch.com berichtet, wurde der sogenannte Yuan-Fix (Umtauschwert von Dollar in Yuan) auf 6.5693 gesetzt. Das ist der tiefste Wert seit über fünf Jahren, heißt es weiter.Aus diesem Grund lassen sich auch Spekulationen anstellen, ob die politischen Einflüsse in China viele Bitcoin Nutzer dazu geführt haben, ihr Vermögen vor der Inflation zu schützen und alternative (digitale) Währungen wie den Bitcoin stärker zu nutzen.Meinung des Autors(Max):Eine Kursanalyse ist gerade deshalb spannend, weil es zum Zeitpunkt des Geschehens keine “richtige” Antwort gibt: Letztendlich lässt sich nur auf finanzieller, politischer oder markttechnischer Ebene spekulieren, welche Aktionen für den rasanten Kursanstieg verantwortlich sind. So wird der wirkliche Grund auch in diesem Fall erst nach den Turbulnzen bekannt werden. Der Zusammenhang mit der Währungsabwertung in China ist dennoch ein realistisches Szenario. In Betracht könnte auch das anstehende Block Halving kommen, dessen Zeitpunkt auf den 10. Juli (ca. 40 Tage) geschätzt wird. Vielleicht haben wir es heute auch einfach mit einer Kombination vieler aufeinandertreffender Faktoren zu tun.BTC-EchoÜber Max Kops Maximilian Kops arbeitet als Analyst und Autor für BTC-ECHO und ist spezialisiert auf Fragen zur technischen Entwicklung von Blockchains als auch zu FinTech-Startups.

06/12/2016,"['Many reading this would enjoy the opportunity to invest a solid $15 million into mining bitcoins, but an NFL star is alleging in civil court that his financial manager, Ameriprise Financial employee Michael Vick, did exactly that – with the star’s money. The tone of the lawsuit makes it seem that the money manager was so confident in his investment at the time that he assured Darren McFadden, a running back for the Dallas Cowboys and rising star in professional American football, that:[Michael Vick] promised to pay back Plaintiff any funds that Plaintiff invested in such business venture. Instead, consistent with Plaintiffs recently-revealed pattern and practice Defendant Vick used Plaintiff’s fund to start this bitcoin “business”, including using all of Plaintiff’s monies to purchase all the necessary infrastructure and materials, only to retain all the revenues generated or derived from the “business” along with all the corresponding business assets purchased with Plaintiffs money.Michael Vick the financial manager should not be confused with the shamed dog-fighting Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback, although they perhaps share a penchant for money making schemes which are less than honest.McFadden recently came to the realization that the man he put in charge of “safeguarding his use of cash to protect his earnings” was in fact squandering it on pointless schemes, more than just the business of Bitcoin mining, which has been rocked by so more scandals than one article can possibly cover. In total, the Bitcoin operation, which is only vaguely referenced in the initial filing, only represents a fifth of the alleged $15 million which Vick is said to have burned. Due to the exhortations of the supposed white collar scam artist, McFadden was compelled in August, 2008 to vest the advisor with power of attorney over much of his assets, a move which essentially gave the manager unlimited authority where McFadden’s monies were concerned.Other failed investments were not specified, leading one to wonder if the use of the term “Bitcoin” is meant to herald its traditional negative connotation in a court environment. In any case, the complaint, filed in Pulaski County, Arkansas, outlines a con artist much more successful than most the Bitcoin world has yielded. Other businesses, besides the supposed Bitcoin mining operation, were all used to directly funnel money to Vick himself. One might conclude that the mining operation never actually existed, or worse the $3 million was invested into a “virtual mining” pyramid scheme such as the one Josh Garza is believed to have run in recent yearss.The actual details of the mining venture will not be available until the case proceeds, and Michael Vick may decide to settle rather than work it out through the justice system, but it would seem a wise move on the part of Vick to convert a fair sum of his misbegotten gains to Bitcoin if he was sure his scheme would eventually be discovered.The case cites Arkansas law which requires certain behavior from financial managers, advisors, and accountants, and alleges numerous counts of fraud, totaling a sum much greater than $15 million if a jury and judge are to decide. Vick could be paying McFadden for the rest of his life, but for McFadden and his attorneys, the case seems to be more about the dishonorable nature of Vick’s activities. McFadden says that Vick was a family friend, and the complaint states:As a fiduciary, Defendant should be held liable for his conduct which did not meet the requisite standards of fair dealing, good faith, honesty, and loyalty and which constitutes self-dealing.Request for comment was not returned by McFadden’s attorneys in time for publication, it being a weekend, but CCN will continue to inquire as to the precise nature of the alleged Bitcoin mining failure. It certainly is an increasingly unprofitable business, mining bitcoins, with difficulty at a near-all-time high on the currently (near) 1.7 million TH/s network. New financial technology is always a good place to hide impropriety, but Vick will be forced to prove in court (should he decide to fight rather than settle the case) that he sincerely believed in the investment, and then will still most likely be compelled to make McFadden whole for his financial injuries.Featured image fAdvertisement:', ""John Biggs is CEO of stealth bitcoin startup Freemit and a former editor at TechCrunch. His work has appeared in publications such as The New York Times, Gizmodo and Men's Health.In this opinion piece, Freemit CEO John Biggs casts a critical eye on the current state of the FinTech industry today.What we’re experiencing in FinTech is a Cambrian explosion of personal and B2B financial apps and services. From wealth-advising robots to cheap equity trading platforms to mortgages in minutes, we are facing a world in which middlemen and women are being replaced by code.But this code has creaky foundations. Zenefits was built upon – and was sued by – an old-guard payroll company. Many modern financial companies are still sending CSV files to central repositories using arbitrarily secure systems. Hackers stole $80 million from SWIFT – a platform that banks use to move money overseas – and were only caught because a human middleman noticed a spelling error.Talking to modern FinTech startups is like talking to the King of Swamp Castle.“When I first came here, this was all swamp,” they say. “Everyone said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built in all the same, just to show them. It sank into the swamp. So I built a second one. That sank into the swamp. So I built a third. That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp. But the fourth one stayed up. And that's what you're going to get, lad, the strongest castle in all of England.”But why do we have to keep building our castles on swamps?***Connecting modern apps to old foundations is a chump’s game. Forcing Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to play nicely with established players in any real sense is a pipe dream akin to Linux on the desktop. Banks will let crypto in on their terms and as long as it benefits them directly. There is no fighting it, no matter how many ramparts you charge and flags you wave.The answer, then, is to create new land. That is happening now, but in a very sneaky way.The “it’s just a blockchain!” crowd have shut up for now because they’ve realized that appeasement doesn’t work. Ethereum, like Hansel, is so hot right now but no one outside of enthusiasts understand it.Then we have the die-hards. These big, Bitcoin-centric companies are shipping small ideas. We need to remember that 21 Inc, a company funded to the tune of $116 million, has released a single flagship product: a Raspberry Pi connected to a fan.What happened to moving heaven and earth to make Bitcoin real? What happened to the endless dream of a united, incorruptible currency? Did it die with hunt for Satoshi?Either the cryptocurrency industry – and not just the mass of enthusiasts – bands together to drain the swamps or finds new, solid lands on which to build. Either way, we’re at a standstill until this thinking changes.We need fiat money to start behaving like bitcoin. We need these new FinTech apps to work across borders, for money to be “interoperable,” transactions to be fair and fast, and ensure that regulations are adhered to, globally. We are working on a way to connect FinTech apps together, to create a network. You can read our white paper here.But we’re not alone. We’re one of several networks with the potential to bring about a true Internet of Value on new land: Stellar, Ripple, Ethereum, and of course Bitcoin, but the way we merge crypto with fiat is the key.We have our own approach and we don’t know who or what is going to emerge as dominant. The paper is a description of what we intend to add to the global conversation. What we do know is that we’re experiencing three major trends at once – a multi-polar world, a FinTech app explosion and massive broadband/smart-phone penetration – and there is an opportunity to take advantage of them all, not just for the success of a company, but truly for the benefit of humanity.We have to stop thinking like the King of Swamp Castle. Repetition while expecting a different result may have worked for the King, but it doesn’t work for businesses.The entire industry needs to finally move off the swamp or else the entire industry will burn down, fall over and then, obviously, sink.Image via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

The tone of the lawsuit makes it seem that the money manager was so confident in his investment at the time that he assured Darren McFadden, a running back for the Dallas Cowboys and rising star in professional American football, that:[Michael Vick] promised to pay back Plaintiff any funds that Plaintiff invested in such business venture. Instead, consistent with Plaintiffs recently-revealed pattern and practice Defendant Vick used Plaintiff’s fund to start this bitcoin “business”, including using all of Plaintiff’s monies to purchase all the necessary infrastructure and materials, only to retain all the revenues generated or derived from the “business” along with all the corresponding business assets purchased with Plaintiffs money.Michael Vick the financial manager should not be confused with the shamed dog-fighting Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback, although they perhaps share a penchant for money making schemes which are less than honest.McFadden recently came to the realization that the man he put in charge of “safeguarding his use of cash to protect his earnings” was in fact squandering it on pointless schemes, more than just the business of Bitcoin mining, which has been rocked by so more scandals than one article can possibly cover. In total, the Bitcoin operation, which is only vaguely referenced in the initial filing, only represents a fifth of the alleged $15 million which Vick is said to have burned. Due to the exhortations of the supposed white collar scam artist, McFadden was compelled in August, 2008 to vest the advisor with power of attorney over much of his assets, a move which essentially gave the manager unlimited authority where McFadden’s monies were concerned.Other failed investments were not specified, leading one to wonder if the use of the term “Bitcoin” is meant to herald its traditional negative connotation in a court environment. In any case, the complaint, filed in Pulaski County, Arkansas, outlines a con artist much more successful than most the Bitcoin world has yielded. Other businesses, besides the supposed Bitcoin mining operation, were all used to directly funnel money to Vick himself. One might conclude that the mining operation never actually existed, or worse the $3 million was invested into a “virtual mining” pyramid scheme such as the one Josh Garza is believed to have run in recent yearss.The actual details of the mining venture will not be available until the case proceeds, and Michael Vick may decide to settle rather than work it out through the justice system, but it would seem a wise move on the part of Vick to convert a fair sum of his misbegotten gains to Bitcoin if he was sure his scheme would eventually be discovered.The case cites Arkansas law which requires certain behavior from financial managers, advisors, and accountants, and alleges numerous counts of fraud, totaling a sum much greater than $15 million if a jury and judge are to decide. Vick could be paying McFadden for the rest of his life, but for McFadden and his attorneys, the case seems to be more about the dishonorable nature of Vick’s activities. McFadden says that Vick was a family friend, and the complaint states:As a fiduciary, Defendant should be held liable for his conduct which did not meet the requisite standards of fair dealing, good faith, honesty, and loyalty and which constitutes self-dealing.Request for comment was not returned by McFadden’s attorneys in time for publication, it being a weekend, but CCN will continue to inquire as to the precise nature of the alleged Bitcoin mining failure. It certainly is an increasingly unprofitable business, mining bitcoins, with difficulty at a near-all-time high on the currently (near) 1.7 million TH/s network. New financial technology is always a good place to hide impropriety, but Vick will be forced to prove in court (should he decide to fight rather than settle the case) that he sincerely believed in the investment, and then will still most likely be compelled to make McFadden whole for his financial injuries.Featured image fAdvertisement:', ""John Biggs is CEO of stealth bitcoin startup Freemit and a former editor at TechCrunch. His work has appeared in publications such as The New York Times, Gizmodo and Men's Health.In this opinion piece, Freemit CEO John Biggs casts a critical eye on the current state of the FinTech industry today.What we’re experiencing in FinTech is a Cambrian explosion of personal and B2B financial apps and services. From wealth-advising robots to cheap equity trading platforms to mortgages in minutes, we are facing a world in which middlemen and women are being replaced by code.But this code has creaky foundations. Zenefits was built upon – and was sued by – an old-guard payroll company. Many modern financial companies are still sending CSV files to central repositories using arbitrarily secure systems. Hackers stole $80 million from SWIFT – a platform that banks use to move money overseas – and were only caught because a human middleman noticed a spelling error.Talking to modern FinTech startups is like talking to the King of Swamp Castle.“When I first came here, this was all swamp,” they say. “Everyone said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built in all the same, just to show them. It sank into the swamp. So I built a second one. That sank into the swamp. So I built a third. That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp. But the fourth one stayed up. And that's what you're going to get, lad, the strongest castle in all of England.”But why do we have to keep building our castles on swamps?***Connecting modern apps to old foundations is a chump’s game. Forcing Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to play nicely with established players in any real sense is a pipe dream akin to Linux on the desktop. Banks will let crypto in on their terms and as long as it benefits them directly. There is no fighting it, no matter how many ramparts you charge and flags you wave.The answer, then, is to create new land. That is happening now, but in a very sneaky way.The “it’s just a blockchain!” crowd have shut up for now because they’ve realized that appeasement doesn’t work. Ethereum, like Hansel, is so hot right now but no one outside of enthusiasts understand it.Then we have the die-hards. These big, Bitcoin-centric companies are shipping small ideas. We need to remember that 21 Inc, a company funded to the tune of $116 million, has released a single flagship product: a Raspberry Pi connected to a fan.What happened to moving heaven and earth to make Bitcoin real? What happened to the endless dream of a united, incorruptible currency? Did it die with hunt for Satoshi?Either the cryptocurrency industry – and not just the mass of enthusiasts – bands together to drain the swamps or finds new, solid lands on which to build. Either way, we’re at a standstill until this thinking changes.We need fiat money to start behaving like bitcoin. We need these new FinTech apps to work across borders, for money to be “interoperable,” transactions to be fair and fast, and ensure that regulations are adhered to, globally. We are working on a way to connect FinTech apps together, to create a network. You can read our white paper here.But we’re not alone. We’re one of several networks with the potential to bring about a true Internet of Value on new land: Stellar, Ripple, Ethereum, and of course Bitcoin, but the way we merge crypto with fiat is the key.We have our own approach and we don’t know who or what is going to emerge as dominant. The paper is a description of what we intend to add to the global conversation. What we do know is that we’re experiencing three major trends at once – a multi-polar world, a FinTech app explosion and massive broadband/smart-phone penetration – and there is an opportunity to take advantage of them all, not just for the success of a company, but truly for the benefit of humanity.We have to stop thinking like the King of Swamp Castle. Repetition while expecting a different result may have worked for the King, but it doesn’t work for businesses.The entire industry needs to finally move off the swamp or else the entire industry will burn down, fall over and then, obviously, sink.Image via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

06/18/2016,"['Bitcoin Classic, a fork of Bitcoin with a doubled two-megabyte block size limit, appears to have failed. Now, many in the Bitcoin community have voiced fears that, with a continued one-megabyte limit, transaction confirmation times and fees will increase to the point where Bitcoin itself is untenable, potentially dooming the cryptocurrency.However, Steven Zeiler, Software Architect at Zen Software and former software architect for Ripple, holds a different view. He feels that the block size limit is at present a non-issue, and that the Bitcoin economy continues to work relatively seamlessly, with no major threats on the horizon from the one-megabyte limit.CoinTelegraph spoke to Zeiler about why the state of Bitcoin is strong despite block size limit challenges.Block size limit issueCoinTelegraph: Do you view a 1MB block size limit to be an issue?Steven Zeiler: I spend Bitcoin nearly every day for regular purchases, using a variety of wallets, services and exchanges, and in my experience the payment network is functioning exceptionally well. Yes, a cap on the block size will eventually raise the fees per, but I\'m confident transaction verification won\'t be too poorly affected, since most merchants don\'t ever wait for a confirmation anyway.The merchants I\'m setting up all use BitPay, which seems to have algorithms for confirming transaction validity instantly with a high degree of certainty. The agorists and smaller businesses I deal with who use regular wallets also aren\'t usually aware of the ""block confirmation"" timescale and simply count the bill as paid when they see the transaction has been broadcast.I did have one issue last year because my wallet didn\'t have adjustable fees and a payment to a Coinbase merchant online was stalled, and I had to deal with customer service, but since then most wallets I use have corrected the problem by offering dynamic fees.Though I haven\'t analyzed the blocks, my hunch is that most blocks have lots of room for transactions with reasonable fees, and we will simply see low-fee transactions crowded out. At the end of the day, with services like Purse.io and Airbitz I can save 5-10% or more on nearly everything I need to live, so a 10 or 25 cent transaction fee doesn\'t even register as important to consider in my mind.Confirmation timesCT: Do you think higher transaction volume will ever make confirmation times an actual issue? Weeklong-plus confirmations, for example.SZ: Everything being equal, more Bitcoin payments might lead to higher confirmation times, but the trend I see is wallets and payment processors researching and implementing technology to increase confidence. The market for wallets is heating up, and the ones with the best confirmation experience and technology will win greater share.Ultimately confirmation comes down to trust, do you trust the person paying you isn\'t going to double-spend? If so your confirmation time is equal to the transaction broadcast propagation time, ie almost instantaneous. When shopping locally, I feel a high degree of trust with my neighbors so trust isn\'t a limiting factor. Chances are that if a transaction makes it into the mempool, it is going to become part of the blockchain.CT: You mentioned increased fees not being an issue because of discounts from using Bitcoin. What about with merchants that offer no discount?SZ: For me, the transaction fee is the cost of doing business, and currently that cost is extremely low. For example I bought two water bottles the other day at Bikram Yoga Portsmouth with Bitcoin, and paid a fee of ten cents on five dollars. That\'s still only 2%, whereas credit cards would be higher. But if I was paying my monthly dues of $100 the fee would still be only ten cents, only 0.1% of the bill much lower than credit cards. Though fees aren\'t a pain, one we are experiencing is lack of a recurring billing protocol for Bitcoin, which would help our yoga studio save money.Potential from increased volumeCT: At what rate, in your opinion, would Bitcoin fees become a problem?SZ: Higher fees have marginal disutility, so as they increase, fees become a problem for more, but different, people. For me, fees have never been a problem. If I hold Bitcoin worth $1,000 and in a year or two it is worth $2,000 because of increased demand and decreased supply, then I don\'t really care how much I\'ve paid in fees. Honestly, the actual amount of the fee has never even registered with me. I do always make sure I pay enough of a fee to go through, though. Maybe if fees go over $1 it will impact day to day use, but that is speculation.It makes sense that miners would ultimately want to maximize the amount of money they make, and given the market size of the entire world population, it seems that an increase in the block size will ultimately yield them more profits than simply raising fees. I believe the potential for fees from increased transaction volume vastly outweighs the potential for higher fees on the same transaction volume, and miners will tend to act like other economic players and maximize for profits. Higher fees very well may prevent poorer people for using Bitcoin, but I\'m interested in using Bitcoin here in New Hampshire, one of the wealthiest places in the world, in an effort to ditch the Federal Reserve system.Competition with fiatCT: Do you see confirmation times and higher fees making Bitcoin lose ground to another cryptocurrency competitor or, worse, to fiat money?SZ: That\'s a great question. I would love to live in a world where the general public is actively discriminating between crypto currencies based on their fees and confirmation time. To answer the question in a word, no, if Bitcoin fails to gain market share against central bank money it is because people like you and me aren\'t talking about the benefit of Bitcoin to their neighbors and friends, to the girl at the coffee shop and the mechanic fixing your car. It\'s our responsibility to teach people that they even want better money. Deep down most people know there is a problem with their money but don\'t even know they have options. For instance, three people this week said they were interested in Bitcoin but couldn\'t afford to buy a whole coin! They aren\'t even aware that you can have $20 worth instead of $750.As far as losing share against other crypto currencies, confirmation time seems less important than fungibility and privacy since Bitcoin was created by anarchists for anarchists who often value anonymity. When I worked at Ripple, we were measuring something like 200 transactions per second with a final confirmation time of three to five seconds. Why then did libertarians and Bitcoin fans hate Ripple so much? Because their system is designed specifically to not be private and anonymous, so no real people (other than bank employees) use Ripple even though it has superior confirmation time, fees and throughput.', 'PriceWaterhouseCooper’s (PwC) Digital Technologies team announced a major project with the Bank of England on Friday. The partners described a concerted effort to see if they can make fiat currencies like the British Pound Sterling work over a blockchain.The experiment created a proof of concept cryptocurrency that offered a “single shared view of transactions,” explained PwC in a release, “allowing every participant simultaneous access to a shared view of information.”- Nick Bouch, PwC financial services data leader and partnerOn the same day the Bank of England\'s governor, Mark Carney, announced that the Bank is “examining how the technology behind bitcoin can improve central banking services, and is at the early stages of examining a digital currency.” The digital currency aspect is only one of the uses for their experimentation, however, and settlement systems appear to be the main focus of their initial explorations. “The prospect of a central bank digital currency for the UK, in my view, [is] still some way off,” Carney said.No more specific details about the inner workings of the blockchain that they created were given, only that the partnership resulted in a successful exploration of the potential opportunities and challenges of using distributed ledger technology for payments and settlement.The news of their partnership comes at a time when many governments are starting to show demand for blockchain-based fiat currency. The Bank of Canada is the latest to claim that they are considering using blockchains for their own currency, which they are calling ‘CAD-Coin.’Several other major banks including the Royal bank of Canada, the Bank of Montreal, CIBC, Scotiabank and TD Bank, are involved in the project, as is the banking consortium startup R3CEV. For now CAD-coin remains in the experimental stage only.Coincidentally, Canada was also the first government to attempt to create a digital currency that citizens could trade with each other, although it wasn’t using an actual blockchain. In 2012 the Royal Canadian Mint developed a USB drive-based currency called the “Mint chip,” but they never perfected it. By 2014, the Canadian government scrapped the program and sold all of the hardware for it at auction.On the day before Canada announced their CAD-coin, the largest Japanese financial group announced a similar program that is further along, although the official word is that it is still in testing and isn’t officially in production yet. Mitsubishi UFJ is building a digital Yen on a blockchain that is to be used on a swipe card, modeled after the popular Suica swipe cards that they use there to pay train fares.The Dutch central bank, De Nederlandsche Bank, released an annual report on 16 March in which they speak of “DNBCoin,” their own ""prototype coin based on blockchain technology."" Their report discussed how blockchain tech could improve their core business, but gave no details on the project\'s release or full objectives, other than putting it in a section marked ""aims for 2016.""The historic first instance of a government giving their approval to use a blockchain-based fiat currency occurred near the end of February in Barbados. Caribbean bitcoin exchange Bitt launched a mobile wallet complete with a digitized version of the Barbadian dollar, using the Bitcoin blockchain to keep track of this digital fiat currency. Impressively, this digital Barbadian Dollar has the full backing of the Central Bank of Barbados, a first of it\'s kind for Bitcoin.The bitcoin exchange has even received $16 million USD in funding from Overstock.com’s CEO Patrick Byrne, with the goal of modernizing trade in a region of the world whose money has been balkanized. Getting Barbadians to adopt the new form of currency is an ongoing process which has yet to gain much ground.Friday’s news is unique in that such large players as the Bank of England and PwC have partnered together, but independently, each has been heavily involved in blockchain research before.The Bank of England has made the news consistently since early 2013 weighing in its’ opinions on blockchain technology, from the time that they speculated about creating a digital currency themselves, to another time when they considered the harm cryptocurrency would do to the lending industry. Mostly, however, they have talked about and experimented at great length with the Real-Time Settlement aspects of cryptocurrency.- Bank of England News ReleaseIn fact, the former executive director of the Bank of England, Sir David Walker left the bank in December to become the chairman of the board at blockchain startup SETL which competes with R3 CEV, although it is primarily focused on settlement.PwC, one of the four largest professional services firms on Earth, has been hard at work studying blockchain technology for years. The firm released a series of reports outlining the benefits of the tech, and in January opened an office in Northern Ireland for the Digital Technologies team, dedicated “to exploit and commercialise blockchain, the technology that powers the crypto-currency, Bitcoin.” It would be difficult to find a more suitable partner for the Bank of England to work with during their attempt to put the Pound on a blockchain.The British megabank’s Chief Information Officer, Rob Elsey, was optimistic about the outcome of the tests and hinted that they’ll be able to deploy similar fiat-over-blockchain networks much faster next time.- Rob Elsey, Bank of England Chief Information Officer', 'The Walmart chain in Canada has announced that it will not be accepting VISA powered credit cards at its outlets from next month. Read more...Whenever there is an issue regarding fiat currency, bitcoin is sure to have the last laugh. Bitcoin has been around for about 8 years as an alternative digital currency, which is perfectly capable of operating of ensuring transfer of value without the intervention of an organization or a government as the trusted third party. The decentralized, open source, peer to peer transaction protocol allows people who are part of the network to act as a third party to facilitate transactions.When it comes to fiat currency, the story is completely different. Every organization, starting from the government appointed Central Bank to the local bank branch or the payment gateway service provider wants to act as the gatekeeper for their customers’ funds and charge a hefty sum for doing so. Customers end up unnecessarily paying for these services which may not even be beneficial for them.Dissatisfaction among customers is a common occurrence in the fiat industry. Recently, Walmart in Canada made its displeasure towards the payment processing giant VISA by announcing that it will not be accepting VISA powered cards anymore from its customers. While the ban is expected to come into effect from July 18, Walmart Canada is not the only store that is pissed off with the credit card provider. According to reports, many medium and small businesses are also facing the same issues where VISA is charging an unacceptably high processing fee for transactions on its cards.Walmart Canada’s move will translate to an effective ban on the cards at over 400 locations across Canada. For the first time, Walmart’s move has received widespread support from small businesses which otherwise do not see eye to eye with the retail giant. few of these small businesses have even decided to follow Walmart Canada’s suit and stop accepting VISA from their merchants too. This has definitely started a debate in the Canadian government circles, with bureaucrats trying to find a solution for the high processing fee.In this fight, the small businesses and customers are the ones to lose out the most. While small businesses depend on their clientele, rejecting some of them for using VISA will definitely drive away the customer. At the same time, credit cards are supposed to make transactions more convenient, but now it turns out that you should have the ‘right’ credit card to enjoy the convenience.Bitcoin for Visa, a great trade-offBitcoin, on the other hand, can effectively put an end to the whole confusion. It is a well-known fact that the digital currency transactions are faster and cheaper. It ideally doesn’t require any third party payment gateway or processing service either. For few pennies as mining fee, transactions can be easily executed over the bitcoin network. Even these businesses have an added advantage compared to their counterparts in other parts of the world. Canada is known to be favorable towards bitcoin and the regulatory support offered by the government make the transition much smoother,Will the Canadian merchants continue to fight with the credit card majors or adopt a much better payment method in the form of bitcoin is something that only time will tell. Till then, happy shopping.', 'Vitalik Buterin wächst mit dem Internet auf. Als er 1994 geboren wird, ist die Welt bereits seit fünf Jahren im World Wide Web. Buterin fängt früh an, selbst zu programmieren. Später schreibt er für einen Blog und wird dafür mit Bitcoins bezahlt. Weil ihm die Digitalwährung jedoch zu viele Schwachstellen hat, entwickelt er seine eigene. Er nennt sie Ethereum. Und er erkennt, dass man mit der Technologie, die hinter Digitalwährungen steckt, sehr viel mehr machen kann. Mit nur 22 Jahren wird Buterin so zum Vorreiter einer neuen Bewegung. Einer Bewegung, die Experten zu Superlativen verleitet. Goldman Sachs spricht vom „Megatrend“, die Bank of England von einer „echten Innovation“. Twitter-Investor Marc Andreessen meint gar: Das sei die größte Erfindung, seit es das Internet gibt.Blockchain ist die Technologie hinter der Digitalwährung BitcoinsDie Rede ist von der Blockchain. Das ist die Technologie, die hinter Bitcoins steckt. Und die nun auch jenseits der Digitalwährung zum Einsatz kommen soll. Bislang brauchte jeder, der Geld überweisen wollte, eine Bank. Sie wickelt die Zahlung ab und prüft, ob alle nötigen Daten stimmen. Die Blockchain-Technologie macht jedoch genau dasselbe – nur vollautomatisch, schneller und billiger. Sie ersetzt somit die Bank. Und wie bei der Überweisung funktioniert das auch bei anderen Geschäften. Neben der Bank kann die Blockchain auch den Stromanbieter ersetzen, den Musikkonzern oder den Immobilienmakler. Denn wie man Geld über diese Technologie hin- und herschicken kann, kann man per Blockchain auch Strom, Musik oder Immobilien kaufen und verkaufen – und zwar ohne dass ein Konzern dazwischengeschaltet ist.Vorstellen kann man sich die Blockchain wie eine Art Superdatei. Sie erfasst alle Transaktionen von allen Beteiligten, die über ihr System abgewickelt werden. Das Besondere: Statt auf einem zentralen Server wird sie gleichzeitig auf den Rechnern aller Teilnehmer gespeichert und dort laufend aktualisiert. Die Folge: Statt von einem Großrechner wird die Transaktion von jedem einzelnen Computer überprüft, der ans Netzwerk angeschlossen ist. Wissen und Verantwortung werden also an Maschinen delegiert und geteilt. Manipulation soll auf diese Weise kaum möglich sein. Denn Kriminelle müssten sich dazu nicht nur in einen, sondern gleich in alle angeschlossenen Rechner hacken.Die Blockchain ist ein intelligentes KassenbuchWie die Blockchain konkret funktioniert, wird am Beispiel der Geldüberweisung klar: Will Person A Geld an Person B transferieren, werden diese Daten verschlüsselt an sämtliche Rechner im Netzwerk übertragen. Die Rechner gleichen die Daten automatisch mit den Informationen ab, die bereits in der Blockchain gespeichert sind. Sie prüfen zum Beispiel, ob das Konto, von dem Person A Geld überweisen will, tatsächlich A gehört. Geben alle Rechner ihr Okay, wird die Transaktion durchgeführt und als Information der Superdatei hinzugefügt. Diese Superdatei ist also nichts anderes als eine ellenlange Kette (Chain), der immer wieder neue Informationen (Blocks) hinzugefügt werden. So entsteht ein riesiges, intelligentes Kassenbuch.Dass manche die Entdeckung der Blockchain als Revolution beschreiben, liegt daran, dass sie Aufgaben übernimmt, von denen man bislang glaubte, für sie eigene Institutionen zu brauchen. Doch mit der Blockchain benötigt man eben keine Bank mehr, um Geld zu überweisen. Man braucht auch keine Börse mehr, um Aktien zu kaufen. Keinen Notar, um ein Testament zu vollstrecken – stattdessen wird den Erben das Geld automatisch überwiesen. Selbst Tech-Firmen, die erst in den letzten Jahren entstanden sind, würden überflüssig. Man bräuchte kein Uber, um einen Taxifahrer zu finden. Keine Firma wie Airbnb, um Mieter und Vermieter von Ferienwohnungen zusammenzubringen.Banken forschen auch selbst an der TechnologieDer Gedanke, dass man für all diese Geschäfte keine Helfershelfer mehr braucht, sondern nur eine schlaue Superdatei, ist zunächst verstörend. Die Deutsche Bank spricht von einem Paradigmenwechsel. Denn nimmt man die Blockchain ernst, muss man Wirtschaft neu denken. So glauben die Wirtschaftsprüfer von Deloitte auch, dass es weniger eine Frage der Technik ist, ob sich die Blockchain durchsetzt. Stattdessen hänge es zu 80 Prozent davon ab, ob Menschen bereit seien umzudenken. Ob sie einer dezentralen Technologie ebenso viel Vertrauen schenken können wie einer zentralen Institution – etwa einer Bank.Die Geldinstitute nehmen die Blockchain dennoch ernst. Schließlich wären sie die Ersten, deren Service die Technologie zumindest in Teilen überflüssig machen könnte. Bei der Deutschen Bank heißt es: „Die Blockchain-Technologie ist eine der ersten wirklich disruptiven Ideen aus dem Fintech-Bereich.“ Um nicht abgehängt zu werden, forschen die Geldhäuser deshalb selbst an der Technologie. Sie hoffen: Wenn sie als Banken die Blockchain selbst bereitstellen, könnte sie das retten. 42 Großbanken haben sich unlängst zu einem Konsortium zusammengeschlossen, das in New York und London die Blockchain erforscht. Die Firma trägt den unscheinbaren Namen R3. Doch die Liste der Institute, die mitmischen, liest sich wie das Who’s who der Finanzwelt: Neben Deutscher Bank und Commerzbank machen etwa Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Barclays und UBS mit. Auch der IT-Konzern Microsoft ist dabei.Parallel arbeiten fast alle Finanzinstitute an eigenen Blockchain-Projekten. JP Morgan soll zum Beispiel derzeit mit über 2000 Kunden das Hin- und Herschicken von Geld zwischen London und Tokio per Blockchain testen. Citigroup hat eine eigene Digitalwährung namens Citicoin entwickelt, um Zahlungen zu vereinfachen.

Now, many in the Bitcoin community have voiced fears that, with a continued one-megabyte limit, transaction confirmation times and fees will increase to the point where Bitcoin itself is untenable, potentially dooming the cryptocurrency.However, Steven Zeiler, Software Architect at Zen Software and former software architect for Ripple, holds a different view. He feels that the block size limit is at present a non-issue, and that the Bitcoin economy continues to work relatively seamlessly, with no major threats on the horizon from the one-megabyte limit.CoinTelegraph spoke to Zeiler about why the state of Bitcoin is strong despite block size limit challenges.Block size limit issueCoinTelegraph: Do you view a 1MB block size limit to be an issue?Steven Zeiler: I spend Bitcoin nearly every day for regular purchases, using a variety of wallets, services and exchanges, and in my experience the payment network is functioning exceptionally well. Yes, a cap on the block size will eventually raise the fees per, but I\'m confident transaction verification won\'t be too poorly affected, since most merchants don\'t ever wait for a confirmation anyway.The merchants I\'m setting up all use BitPay, which seems to have algorithms for confirming transaction validity instantly with a high degree of certainty. The agorists and smaller businesses I deal with who use regular wallets also aren\'t usually aware of the ""block confirmation"" timescale and simply count the bill as paid when they see the transaction has been broadcast.I did have one issue last year because my wallet didn\'t have adjustable fees and a payment to a Coinbase merchant online was stalled, and I had to deal with customer service, but since then most wallets I use have corrected the problem by offering dynamic fees.Though I haven\'t analyzed the blocks, my hunch is that most blocks have lots of room for transactions with reasonable fees, and we will simply see low-fee transactions crowded out. At the end of the day, with services like Purse.io and Airbitz I can save 5-10% or more on nearly everything I need to live, so a 10 or 25 cent transaction fee doesn\'t even register as important to consider in my mind.Confirmation timesCT: Do you think higher transaction volume will ever make confirmation times an actual issue? Weeklong-plus confirmations, for example.SZ: Everything being equal, more Bitcoin payments might lead to higher confirmation times, but the trend I see is wallets and payment processors researching and implementing technology to increase confidence. The market for wallets is heating up, and the ones with the best confirmation experience and technology will win greater share.Ultimately confirmation comes down to trust, do you trust the person paying you isn\'t going to double-spend? If so your confirmation time is equal to the transaction broadcast propagation time, ie almost instantaneous. When shopping locally, I feel a high degree of trust with my neighbors so trust isn\'t a limiting factor. Chances are that if a transaction makes it into the mempool, it is going to become part of the blockchain.CT: You mentioned increased fees not being an issue because of discounts from using Bitcoin. What about with merchants that offer no discount?SZ: For me, the transaction fee is the cost of doing business, and currently that cost is extremely low. For example I bought two water bottles the other day at Bikram Yoga Portsmouth with Bitcoin, and paid a fee of ten cents on five dollars. That\'s still only 2%, whereas credit cards would be higher. But if I was paying my monthly dues of $100 the fee would still be only ten cents, only 0.1% of the bill much lower than credit cards. Though fees aren\'t a pain, one we are experiencing is lack of a recurring billing protocol for Bitcoin, which would help our yoga studio save money.Potential from increased volumeCT: At what rate, in your opinion, would Bitcoin fees become a problem?SZ: Higher fees have marginal disutility, so as they increase, fees become a problem for more, but different, people. For me, fees have never been a problem. If I hold Bitcoin worth $1,000 and in a year or two it is worth $2,000 because of increased demand and decreased supply, then I don\'t really care how much I\'ve paid in fees. Honestly, the actual amount of the fee has never even registered with me. I do always make sure I pay enough of a fee to go through, though. Maybe if fees go over $1 it will impact day to day use, but that is speculation.It makes sense that miners would ultimately want to maximize the amount of money they make, and given the market size of the entire world population, it seems that an increase in the block size will ultimately yield them more profits than simply raising fees. I believe the potential for fees from increased transaction volume vastly outweighs the potential for higher fees on the same transaction volume, and miners will tend to act like other economic players and maximize for profits. Higher fees very well may prevent poorer people for using Bitcoin, but I\'m interested in using Bitcoin here in New Hampshire, one of the wealthiest places in the world, in an effort to ditch the Federal Reserve system.Competition with fiatCT: Do you see confirmation times and higher fees making Bitcoin lose ground to another cryptocurrency competitor or, worse, to fiat money?SZ: That\'s a great question. I would love to live in a world where the general public is actively discriminating between crypto currencies based on their fees and confirmation time. To answer the question in a word, no, if Bitcoin fails to gain market share against central bank money it is because people like you and me aren\'t talking about the benefit of Bitcoin to their neighbors and friends, to the girl at the coffee shop and the mechanic fixing your car. It\'s our responsibility to teach people that they even want better money. Deep down most people know there is a problem with their money but don\'t even know they have options. For instance, three people this week said they were interested in Bitcoin but couldn\'t afford to buy a whole coin! They aren\'t even aware that you can have $20 worth instead of $750.As far as losing share against other crypto currencies, confirmation time seems less important than fungibility and privacy since Bitcoin was created by anarchists for anarchists who often value anonymity. When I worked at Ripple, we were measuring something like 200 transactions per second with a final confirmation time of three to five seconds. Why then did libertarians and Bitcoin fans hate Ripple so much? Because their system is designed specifically to not be private and anonymous, so no real people (other than bank employees) use Ripple even though it has superior confirmation time, fees and throughput.', 'PriceWaterhouseCooper’s (PwC) Digital Technologies team announced a major project with the Bank of England on Friday. The partners described a concerted effort to see if they can make fiat currencies like the British Pound Sterling work over a blockchain.The experiment created a proof of concept cryptocurrency that offered a “single shared view of transactions,” explained PwC in a release, “allowing every participant simultaneous access to a shared view of information.”- Nick Bouch, PwC financial services data leader and partnerOn the same day the Bank of England\'s governor, Mark Carney, announced that the Bank is “examining how the technology behind bitcoin can improve central banking services, and is at the early stages of examining a digital currency.” The digital currency aspect is only one of the uses for their experimentation, however, and settlement systems appear to be the main focus of their initial explorations. “The prospect of a central bank digital currency for the UK, in my view, [is] still some way off,” Carney said.No more specific details about the inner workings of the blockchain that they created were given, only that the partnership resulted in a successful exploration of the potential opportunities and challenges of using distributed ledger technology for payments and settlement.The news of their partnership comes at a time when many governments are starting to show demand for blockchain-based fiat currency. The Bank of Canada is the latest to claim that they are considering using blockchains for their own currency, which they are calling ‘CAD-Coin.’Several other major banks including the Royal bank of Canada, the Bank of Montreal, CIBC, Scotiabank and TD Bank, are involved in the project, as is the banking consortium startup R3CEV. For now CAD-coin remains in the experimental stage only.Coincidentally, Canada was also the first government to attempt to create a digital currency that citizens could trade with each other, although it wasn’t using an actual blockchain. In 2012 the Royal Canadian Mint developed a USB drive-based currency called the “Mint chip,” but they never perfected it. By 2014, the Canadian government scrapped the program and sold all of the hardware for it at auction.On the day before Canada announced their CAD-coin, the largest Japanese financial group announced a similar program that is further along, although the official word is that it is still in testing and isn’t officially in production yet. Mitsubishi UFJ is building a digital Yen on a blockchain that is to be used on a swipe card, modeled after the popular Suica swipe cards that they use there to pay train fares.The Dutch central bank, De Nederlandsche Bank, released an annual report on 16 March in which they speak of “DNBCoin,” their own ""prototype coin based on blockchain technology."" Their report discussed how blockchain tech could improve their core business, but gave no details on the project\'s release or full objectives, other than putting it in a section marked ""aims for 2016.""The historic first instance of a government giving their approval to use a blockchain-based fiat currency occurred near the end of February in Barbados. Caribbean bitcoin exchange Bitt launched a mobile wallet complete with a digitized version of the Barbadian dollar, using the Bitcoin blockchain to keep track of this digital fiat currency. Impressively, this digital Barbadian Dollar has the full backing of the Central Bank of Barbados, a first of it\'s kind for Bitcoin.The bitcoin exchange has even received $16 million USD in funding from Overstock.com’s CEO Patrick Byrne, with the goal of modernizing trade in a region of the world whose money has been balkanized. Getting Barbadians to adopt the new form of currency is an ongoing process which has yet to gain much ground.Friday’s news is unique in that such large players as the Bank of England and PwC have partnered together, but independently, each has been heavily involved in blockchain research before.The Bank of England has made the news consistently since early 2013 weighing in its’ opinions on blockchain technology, from the time that they speculated about creating a digital currency themselves, to another time when they considered the harm cryptocurrency would do to the lending industry. Mostly, however, they have talked about and experimented at great length with the Real-Time Settlement aspects of cryptocurrency.- Bank of England News ReleaseIn fact, the former executive director of the Bank of England, Sir David Walker left the bank in December to become the chairman of the board at blockchain startup SETL which competes with R3 CEV, although it is primarily focused on settlement.PwC, one of the four largest professional services firms on Earth, has been hard at work studying blockchain technology for years. The firm released a series of reports outlining the benefits of the tech, and in January opened an office in Northern Ireland for the Digital Technologies team, dedicated “to exploit and commercialise blockchain, the technology that powers the crypto-currency, Bitcoin.” It would be difficult to find a more suitable partner for the Bank of England to work with during their attempt to put the Pound on a blockchain.The British megabank’s Chief Information Officer, Rob Elsey, was optimistic about the outcome of the tests and hinted that they’ll be able to deploy similar fiat-over-blockchain networks much faster next time.- Rob Elsey, Bank of England Chief Information Officer', 'The Walmart chain in Canada has announced that it will not be accepting VISA powered credit cards at its outlets from next month. Read more...Whenever there is an issue regarding fiat currency, bitcoin is sure to have the last laugh. Bitcoin has been around for about 8 years as an alternative digital currency, which is perfectly capable of operating of ensuring transfer of value without the intervention of an organization or a government as the trusted third party. The decentralized, open source, peer to peer transaction protocol allows people who are part of the network to act as a third party to facilitate transactions.When it comes to fiat currency, the story is completely different. Every organization, starting from the government appointed Central Bank to the local bank branch or the payment gateway service provider wants to act as the gatekeeper for their customers’ funds and charge a hefty sum for doing so. Customers end up unnecessarily paying for these services which may not even be beneficial for them.Dissatisfaction among customers is a common occurrence in the fiat industry. Recently, Walmart in Canada made its displeasure towards the payment processing giant VISA by announcing that it will not be accepting VISA powered cards anymore from its customers. While the ban is expected to come into effect from July 18, Walmart Canada is not the only store that is pissed off with the credit card provider. According to reports, many medium and small businesses are also facing the same issues where VISA is charging an unacceptably high processing fee for transactions on its cards.Walmart Canada’s move will translate to an effective ban on the cards at over 400 locations across Canada. For the first time, Walmart’s move has received widespread support from small businesses which otherwise do not see eye to eye with the retail giant. few of these small businesses have even decided to follow Walmart Canada’s suit and stop accepting VISA from their merchants too. This has definitely started a debate in the Canadian government circles, with bureaucrats trying to find a solution for the high processing fee.In this fight, the small businesses and customers are the ones to lose out the most. While small businesses depend on their clientele, rejecting some of them for using VISA will definitely drive away the customer. At the same time, credit cards are supposed to make transactions more convenient, but now it turns out that you should have the ‘right’ credit card to enjoy the convenience.Bitcoin for Visa, a great trade-offBitcoin, on the other hand, can effectively put an end to the whole confusion. It is a well-known fact that the digital currency transactions are faster and cheaper. It ideally doesn’t require any third party payment gateway or processing service either. For few pennies as mining fee, transactions can be easily executed over the bitcoin network. Even these businesses have an added advantage compared to their counterparts in other parts of the world. Canada is known to be favorable towards bitcoin and the regulatory support offered by the government make the transition much smoother,Will the Canadian merchants continue to fight with the credit card majors or adopt a much better payment method in the form of bitcoin is something that only time will tell. Till then, happy shopping.', 'Vitalik Buterin wächst mit dem Internet auf. Als er 1994 geboren wird, ist die Welt bereits seit fünf Jahren im World Wide Web. Buterin fängt früh an, selbst zu programmieren. Später schreibt er für einen Blog und wird dafür mit Bitcoins bezahlt. Weil ihm die Digitalwährung jedoch zu viele Schwachstellen hat, entwickelt er seine eigene. Er nennt sie Ethereum. Und er erkennt, dass man mit der Technologie, die hinter Digitalwährungen steckt, sehr viel mehr machen kann. Mit nur 22 Jahren wird Buterin so zum Vorreiter einer neuen Bewegung. Einer Bewegung, die Experten zu Superlativen verleitet. Goldman Sachs spricht vom „Megatrend“, die Bank of England von einer „echten Innovation“. Twitter-Investor Marc Andreessen meint gar: Das sei die größte Erfindung, seit es das Internet gibt.Blockchain ist die Technologie hinter der Digitalwährung BitcoinsDie Rede ist von der Blockchain. Das ist die Technologie, die hinter Bitcoins steckt. Und die nun auch jenseits der Digitalwährung zum Einsatz kommen soll. Bislang brauchte jeder, der Geld überweisen wollte, eine Bank. Sie wickelt die Zahlung ab und prüft, ob alle nötigen Daten stimmen. Die Blockchain-Technologie macht jedoch genau dasselbe – nur vollautomatisch, schneller und billiger. Sie ersetzt somit die Bank. Und wie bei der Überweisung funktioniert das auch bei anderen Geschäften. Neben der Bank kann die Blockchain auch den Stromanbieter ersetzen, den Musikkonzern oder den Immobilienmakler. Denn wie man Geld über diese Technologie hin- und herschicken kann, kann man per Blockchain auch Strom, Musik oder Immobilien kaufen und verkaufen – und zwar ohne dass ein Konzern dazwischengeschaltet ist.Vorstellen kann man sich die Blockchain wie eine Art Superdatei. Sie erfasst alle Transaktionen von allen Beteiligten, die über ihr System abgewickelt werden. Das Besondere: Statt auf einem zentralen Server wird sie gleichzeitig auf den Rechnern aller Teilnehmer gespeichert und dort laufend aktualisiert. Die Folge: Statt von einem Großrechner wird die Transaktion von jedem einzelnen Computer überprüft, der ans Netzwerk angeschlossen ist. Wissen und Verantwortung werden also an Maschinen delegiert und geteilt. Manipulation soll auf diese Weise kaum möglich sein. Denn Kriminelle müssten sich dazu nicht nur in einen, sondern gleich in alle angeschlossenen Rechner hacken.Die Blockchain ist ein intelligentes KassenbuchWie die Blockchain konkret funktioniert, wird am Beispiel der Geldüberweisung klar: Will Person A Geld an Person B transferieren, werden diese Daten verschlüsselt an sämtliche Rechner im Netzwerk übertragen. Die Rechner gleichen die Daten automatisch mit den Informationen ab, die bereits in der Blockchain gespeichert sind. Sie prüfen zum Beispiel, ob das Konto, von dem Person A Geld überweisen will, tatsächlich A gehört. Geben alle Rechner ihr Okay, wird die Transaktion durchgeführt und als Information der Superdatei hinzugefügt. Diese Superdatei ist also nichts anderes als eine ellenlange Kette (Chain), der immer wieder neue Informationen (Blocks) hinzugefügt werden. So entsteht ein riesiges, intelligentes Kassenbuch.Dass manche die Entdeckung der Blockchain als Revolution beschreiben, liegt daran, dass sie Aufgaben übernimmt, von denen man bislang glaubte, für sie eigene Institutionen zu brauchen. Doch mit der Blockchain benötigt man eben keine Bank mehr, um Geld zu überweisen. Man braucht auch keine Börse mehr, um Aktien zu kaufen. Keinen Notar, um ein Testament zu vollstrecken – stattdessen wird den Erben das Geld automatisch überwiesen. Selbst Tech-Firmen, die erst in den letzten Jahren entstanden sind, würden überflüssig. Man bräuchte kein Uber, um einen Taxifahrer zu finden. Keine Firma wie Airbnb, um Mieter und Vermieter von Ferienwohnungen zusammenzubringen.Banken forschen auch selbst an der TechnologieDer Gedanke, dass man für all diese Geschäfte keine Helfershelfer mehr braucht, sondern nur eine schlaue Superdatei, ist zunächst verstörend. Die Deutsche Bank spricht von einem Paradigmenwechsel. Denn nimmt man die Blockchain ernst, muss man Wirtschaft neu denken. So glauben die Wirtschaftsprüfer von Deloitte auch, dass es weniger eine Frage der Technik ist, ob sich die Blockchain durchsetzt. Stattdessen hänge es zu 80 Prozent davon ab, ob Menschen bereit seien umzudenken. Ob sie einer dezentralen Technologie ebenso viel Vertrauen schenken können wie einer zentralen Institution – etwa einer Bank.Die Geldinstitute nehmen die Blockchain dennoch ernst. Schließlich wären sie die Ersten, deren Service die Technologie zumindest in Teilen überflüssig machen könnte. Bei der Deutschen Bank heißt es: „Die Blockchain-Technologie ist eine der ersten wirklich disruptiven Ideen aus dem Fintech-Bereich.“ Um nicht abgehängt zu werden, forschen die Geldhäuser deshalb selbst an der Technologie. Sie hoffen: Wenn sie als Banken die Blockchain selbst bereitstellen, könnte sie das retten. 42 Großbanken haben sich unlängst zu einem Konsortium zusammengeschlossen, das in New York und London die Blockchain erforscht. Die Firma trägt den unscheinbaren Namen R3. Doch die Liste der Institute, die mitmischen, liest sich wie das Who’s who der Finanzwelt: Neben Deutscher Bank und Commerzbank machen etwa Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Barclays und UBS mit. Auch der IT-Konzern Microsoft ist dabei.Parallel arbeiten fast alle Finanzinstitute an eigenen Blockchain-Projekten. JP Morgan soll zum Beispiel derzeit mit über 2000 Kunden das Hin- und Herschicken von Geld zwischen London und Tokio per Blockchain testen. Citigroup hat eine eigene Digitalwährung namens Citicoin entwickelt, um Zahlungen zu vereinfachen. Die Kreditkartenfirma Visa arbeitet daran, Überweisungen von Migranten in ihre Heimat zu erleichtern – was teure Transferdienste wie Western Union überflüssig machen könnte.Auch die Energieversorger befassen sich mit der BlockchainUnd das ist erst der Anfang, denn die Blockchain ist nicht nur etwas für die Finanzindustrie.

08/06/2016,"['Bitcoin, a Florida judge says, is not real money. Ironically, that could provide a boost to use of the crypto-currency which has remained in the shadows of the financial system.The July 22 ruling by Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Teresa Pooler means that no specific license is needed to buy and sell bitcoins.The judge dismissed a case against Michel Espinoza, who had faced money laundering and other criminal charges for attempting to sell $1,500 worth of bitcoins to an undercover agent who told the defendant he was going to use the virtual money to buy stolen credit card numbers.Espinoza\'s lawyer Rene Palomino said the judge acknowledged that it was not illegal to sell one\'s property and ruled that this did not constitute running an unauthorized financial service.""He was selling his own personal bitcoins,"" Palomino said. ""This decision clears the way for you to do that in the state of the Florida without a money transmitting license.""In her ruling, Pooler said, ""this court is unwilling to punish a man for selling his property to another, when his actions fall under a statute that is so vaguely written that even legal professionals have difficulty finding a singular meaning.""She added that ""this court is not an expert in economics,"" but that bitcoin ""has a long way to go before it is the equivalent of money.""Bitcoin, whose origins remain a mystery, is a virtual currency that is created from computer code and is not backed by any government. Advocates say this makes it an efficient alternative to traditional currencies because it is not subject to the whims of a state that may devalue its money to cut its debt, for example.Bitcoins can be exchanged for goods and services, provided another party is willing to accept them, but until now they been used mostly for shady transactions or to buy illegal goods and services on the ""dark"" web.Bitcoin was launched in 2009 as a bit of software written under the Japanese-sounding name Satoshi Nakamoto. This year Australian programmer Craig Wright claimed to be the author but failed to convince the broader bitcoin community.In some areas of the United States bitcoin is accepted in stores, restaurants and online transactions, but it is illegal in some countries, notably France and China.It is gaining ground in countries with high inflation such as Argentina and Venezuela.But bitcoin values can be volatile. Over the past week its value slumped 20 percent in a day, then recouped most losses, after news that a Hong Kong bitcoin exchange had been hacked with some $65 million missing.Impact across US, worldArthur Long, a lawyer specializing in the sector with the New York firm Gibson Dunn, said the July court ruling is a small victory for the virtual currency but that it\'s not clear if the interpretation will be the same in other US states or at the federal level.""It may have an effect as some states are trying to use existing money transmitting statutes to regulate certain transactions in bitcoin,"" Long told AFP.Charles Evans, professor of finance at Barry University, said the ruling ""absolutely is going to provide some guidance in other courts"" and could potentially be used as a precedent in other countries to avoid the stigma associated with bitcoin use.Bitcoins can store value and hedge against inflation, without being considered a monetary unit, according to Evans, who testified as an expert witness in the Florida trial.""It can be used as an exchange,"" he said, and may be considered a commodity which can be used for bartering like fish or tobacco, for example.Evans noted that ""those who are not yet in the bitcoin community will be put on notice: as long as they organize their business in a particular way they can avoid the law.""But he added that ""people who are engaged in illegal activities will continue to do what they are going to do because they are criminals.""Explore further: Factbox: What is Bitcoin?', 'Brelion is a crowdfunding platform that connects investors with real estate companies looking for loans. The company primarily lists non-owner occupied residential projects lasting 12 to 24 months, as well as small to mid-size apartment and commercial property ventures.- BrelionThe website currently lists 32 properties, four are accepting investments, although Brelion only serves accredited investors. According to the SEC, “accredited investors” (i) earn at least $200,000 per year, or $300,000 per year with their spouse; or (ii) have a net worth of at least $1 million, excluding principal residence.”Brelion projects typically fall into two investing categories, debt financing or equity financing. For debt projects, investors receive interest payments from real estate companies each month after a project is funded. The principle paid when a project is completed and the company exits. For equity projects, investors receive a percentage of the profits that the project ultimately yields.- BrelionThe Ohio-based company recently started a pilot project, “driven purely by our love for innovations,” claims founder and CEO Vadim Kleyner. His website now hosts a Bitcoin digital currency real estate investment option; a four bedroom suburban residence.The 12 month project will involve renovating the property, and then refinancing to return equity to investors. The property was purchased for approximately 30.83 XBT, renovations are expected to cost an estimated 65.49 XBT. The project manager expects the property to appraise for approximately 120.21 XBT on completion.- BrelionThe company’s website follows the crowdfunding format popularized by Kickstarter and Indiegogo, but offers investments on property projects. The site claims to be highly secure, with “several layers of advanced software security and data encryption protocols, including SSL 256 bit certificate, hosted in Microsoft Azure Cloud.” The website also claims to offer some of the IT industry’s “most cutting-edge security features.”The business model was made legal last year, when the SEC announced new rules allowing equity crowdfunding. One of the first operational equity crowdfunding platforms in the USA was EquityNet, and other early platforms include CrowdCube and Seedrs in the UK. Kleyner points out that his business also falls under the Exchange Act Rule 3a4–1, which other fundraising platforms use to legally skip registering as a broker.BraveNewCoin spoke with Kleyner about the pilot project. According to the Brelion site, Kleyner has more than 20 years of IT experience and a decade of real estate experience. The new Bitcoin pilot is a “proof of concept,” the CEO told us. “We are setting up systems and processes, policies and procedures of accepting Cryptocurrency globally [...] As well as evaluating the interest.”- Brelion Pilot AnnouncementThe minimum investment is 5 bitcoin, which Kleyner says he protects in a multi-step, secure process that requires an AML/KYC check. “Until project is fully funded BitCoins are being held in the wallet with multisig security,” he explained.However, the company lists no insurance plan in case they are hacked or otherwise disappear. “There is no insurance or option play to protect Brelion as essentially it is Brelion who will be losing out if price of bitcoin goes up,” explained Kleyner. “Brelion will insure investors against BitCoin fluctuation, but not against sponsors performance.”If and when the project is fully funded, Brelion will convert the bitcoins to fiat, and pass them on to the project manager. The 13% annualized return will be paid in fiat, minus the platforms 1% fee. Brelion will then exchange it for bitcoins and distribute it to investors.- BrelionAlthough Brelion may have been the first to offer investments in their niche through bitcoin, real estate has been available through sites like BitPremier for some time. The company is headed by Alan Silbert, brother of Digital Currency Group Founder & CEO, Barry Silbert.Other bitcoin investment platforms with track records, such as BTCJam and BitBond, offer various types of loans. They also provide an auto-invest feature to make diversification easier.', 'Upon his return from medical leave, Overstock CEO Patrick Bryne has appointed Jonathan Johnson as the head of Medici, the firm’s group of fintech and Blockchain businesses, to maintain its long-term growth and investments.Since the launch of Medici in early 2014, Overstock has been long involved in the fintech and cryptocurrency industries, developing various Blockchain-based products and funding several fintech and Bitcoin companies.Development of T0.comAmongst its many projects, Overstock’s Medici has focused on the development of T0.com, a cryptographically protected asset and transaction settlement platform, as a core part of their operation and business. The T0.com platform successfully demonstrated the potential of the Blockchain technology in the financial settlement and clearance market in early 2015, after offering US$25 million corporate bond as the world’s first crypto security.It continued to prove its efficiency in the market since then securing numerous partnerships, including a contract with shareholder intelligence provider Georgson, to publicly offer digital securities on a regulated platform.With the expertise and pro-freedom instincts of Jonathan Johnson, Bryne believes that Medici will continually pioneer the application of the Blockchain technology to financial systems by maximizing its potential and advantages over centralized financial institutions.Bryne says:“Jonathan shares my pro-freedom instincts, and therefore also shares my excitement about the Blockchain revolution’s potential to reduce society’s dependence upon certain rent-seeking and capture-prone centralized institutions.”Fintech and Blockchain startupsJohnson will also be overseeing Medici and Overstock funded fintech and Blockchain startups, to kickstart the development of innovative Blockchain-based financial applications and platforms. Some of the startups include Bitt.com, PeerNova and IdentityMind, all of which leverage the Blockchain technology to offer services that are not offered by existing companies and centralized institutions.Bitt for instance, a Caribbean Islands-based Bitcoin startup, has received US$ 4 million from Overstock to provide Bitcoin-based remittance services for mainstream users.Overstock and Jonathan Johnson-led Medici will continue to revolutionize the finance industry and demonstrate the potential of the Blockchain technology in the market.', ""About The AuthorJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Ironically, that could provide a boost to use of the crypto-currency which has remained in the shadows of the financial system.The July 22 ruling by Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Teresa Pooler means that no specific license is needed to buy and sell bitcoins.The judge dismissed a case against Michel Espinoza, who had faced money laundering and other criminal charges for attempting to sell $1,500 worth of bitcoins to an undercover agent who told the defendant he was going to use the virtual money to buy stolen credit card numbers.Espinoza\'s lawyer Rene Palomino said the judge acknowledged that it was not illegal to sell one\'s property and ruled that this did not constitute running an unauthorized financial service.""He was selling his own personal bitcoins,"" Palomino said. ""This decision clears the way for you to do that in the state of the Florida without a money transmitting license.""In her ruling, Pooler said, ""this court is unwilling to punish a man for selling his property to another, when his actions fall under a statute that is so vaguely written that even legal professionals have difficulty finding a singular meaning.""She added that ""this court is not an expert in economics,"" but that bitcoin ""has a long way to go before it is the equivalent of money.""Bitcoin, whose origins remain a mystery, is a virtual currency that is created from computer code and is not backed by any government. Advocates say this makes it an efficient alternative to traditional currencies because it is not subject to the whims of a state that may devalue its money to cut its debt, for example.Bitcoins can be exchanged for goods and services, provided another party is willing to accept them, but until now they been used mostly for shady transactions or to buy illegal goods and services on the ""dark"" web.Bitcoin was launched in 2009 as a bit of software written under the Japanese-sounding name Satoshi Nakamoto. This year Australian programmer Craig Wright claimed to be the author but failed to convince the broader bitcoin community.In some areas of the United States bitcoin is accepted in stores, restaurants and online transactions, but it is illegal in some countries, notably France and China.It is gaining ground in countries with high inflation such as Argentina and Venezuela.But bitcoin values can be volatile. Over the past week its value slumped 20 percent in a day, then recouped most losses, after news that a Hong Kong bitcoin exchange had been hacked with some $65 million missing.Impact across US, worldArthur Long, a lawyer specializing in the sector with the New York firm Gibson Dunn, said the July court ruling is a small victory for the virtual currency but that it\'s not clear if the interpretation will be the same in other US states or at the federal level.""It may have an effect as some states are trying to use existing money transmitting statutes to regulate certain transactions in bitcoin,"" Long told AFP.Charles Evans, professor of finance at Barry University, said the ruling ""absolutely is going to provide some guidance in other courts"" and could potentially be used as a precedent in other countries to avoid the stigma associated with bitcoin use.Bitcoins can store value and hedge against inflation, without being considered a monetary unit, according to Evans, who testified as an expert witness in the Florida trial.""It can be used as an exchange,"" he said, and may be considered a commodity which can be used for bartering like fish or tobacco, for example.Evans noted that ""those who are not yet in the bitcoin community will be put on notice: as long as they organize their business in a particular way they can avoid the law.""But he added that ""people who are engaged in illegal activities will continue to do what they are going to do because they are criminals.""Explore further: Factbox: What is Bitcoin?', 'Brelion is a crowdfunding platform that connects investors with real estate companies looking for loans. The company primarily lists non-owner occupied residential projects lasting 12 to 24 months, as well as small to mid-size apartment and commercial property ventures.- BrelionThe website currently lists 32 properties, four are accepting investments, although Brelion only serves accredited investors. According to the SEC, “accredited investors” (i) earn at least $200,000 per year, or $300,000 per year with their spouse; or (ii) have a net worth of at least $1 million, excluding principal residence.”Brelion projects typically fall into two investing categories, debt financing or equity financing. For debt projects, investors receive interest payments from real estate companies each month after a project is funded. The principle paid when a project is completed and the company exits. For equity projects, investors receive a percentage of the profits that the project ultimately yields.- BrelionThe Ohio-based company recently started a pilot project, “driven purely by our love for innovations,” claims founder and CEO Vadim Kleyner. His website now hosts a Bitcoin digital currency real estate investment option; a four bedroom suburban residence.The 12 month project will involve renovating the property, and then refinancing to return equity to investors. The property was purchased for approximately 30.83 XBT, renovations are expected to cost an estimated 65.49 XBT. The project manager expects the property to appraise for approximately 120.21 XBT on completion.- BrelionThe company’s website follows the crowdfunding format popularized by Kickstarter and Indiegogo, but offers investments on property projects. The site claims to be highly secure, with “several layers of advanced software security and data encryption protocols, including SSL 256 bit certificate, hosted in Microsoft Azure Cloud.” The website also claims to offer some of the IT industry’s “most cutting-edge security features.”The business model was made legal last year, when the SEC announced new rules allowing equity crowdfunding. One of the first operational equity crowdfunding platforms in the USA was EquityNet, and other early platforms include CrowdCube and Seedrs in the UK. Kleyner points out that his business also falls under the Exchange Act Rule 3a4–1, which other fundraising platforms use to legally skip registering as a broker.BraveNewCoin spoke with Kleyner about the pilot project. According to the Brelion site, Kleyner has more than 20 years of IT experience and a decade of real estate experience. The new Bitcoin pilot is a “proof of concept,” the CEO told us. “We are setting up systems and processes, policies and procedures of accepting Cryptocurrency globally [...] As well as evaluating the interest.”- Brelion Pilot AnnouncementThe minimum investment is 5 bitcoin, which Kleyner says he protects in a multi-step, secure process that requires an AML/KYC check. “Until project is fully funded BitCoins are being held in the wallet with multisig security,” he explained.However, the company lists no insurance plan in case they are hacked or otherwise disappear. “There is no insurance or option play to protect Brelion as essentially it is Brelion who will be losing out if price of bitcoin goes up,” explained Kleyner. “Brelion will insure investors against BitCoin fluctuation, but not against sponsors performance.”If and when the project is fully funded, Brelion will convert the bitcoins to fiat, and pass them on to the project manager. The 13% annualized return will be paid in fiat, minus the platforms 1% fee. Brelion will then exchange it for bitcoins and distribute it to investors.- BrelionAlthough Brelion may have been the first to offer investments in their niche through bitcoin, real estate has been available through sites like BitPremier for some time. The company is headed by Alan Silbert, brother of Digital Currency Group Founder & CEO, Barry Silbert.Other bitcoin investment platforms with track records, such as BTCJam and BitBond, offer various types of loans. They also provide an auto-invest feature to make diversification easier.', 'Upon his return from medical leave, Overstock CEO Patrick Bryne has appointed Jonathan Johnson as the head of Medici, the firm’s group of fintech and Blockchain businesses, to maintain its long-term growth and investments.Since the launch of Medici in early 2014, Overstock has been long involved in the fintech and cryptocurrency industries, developing various Blockchain-based products and funding several fintech and Bitcoin companies.Development of T0.comAmongst its many projects, Overstock’s Medici has focused on the development of T0.com, a cryptographically protected asset and transaction settlement platform, as a core part of their operation and business. The T0.com platform successfully demonstrated the potential of the Blockchain technology in the financial settlement and clearance market in early 2015, after offering US$25 million corporate bond as the world’s first crypto security.It continued to prove its efficiency in the market since then securing numerous partnerships, including a contract with shareholder intelligence provider Georgson, to publicly offer digital securities on a regulated platform.With the expertise and pro-freedom instincts of Jonathan Johnson, Bryne believes that Medici will continually pioneer the application of the Blockchain technology to financial systems by maximizing its potential and advantages over centralized financial institutions.Bryne says:“Jonathan shares my pro-freedom instincts, and therefore also shares my excitement about the Blockchain revolution’s potential to reduce society’s dependence upon certain rent-seeking and capture-prone centralized institutions.”Fintech and Blockchain startupsJohnson will also be overseeing Medici and Overstock funded fintech and Blockchain startups, to kickstart the development of innovative Blockchain-based financial applications and platforms. Some of the startups include Bitt.com, PeerNova and IdentityMind, all of which leverage the Blockchain technology to offer services that are not offered by existing companies and centralized institutions.Bitt for instance, a Caribbean Islands-based Bitcoin startup, has received US$ 4 million from Overstock to provide Bitcoin-based remittance services for mainstream users.Overstock and Jonathan Johnson-led Medici will continue to revolutionize the finance industry and demonstrate the potential of the Blockchain technology in the market.', ""About The AuthorJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

The Bitcoin exchange, Bitfinex, says leaning on its users to cover the loss is the best way to avoid insolvency.Tokyo: For years, Tian Jia made the kind of returns on his money that investors in the rest of the world could only dream of.The 29-year-old Beijing-based programmer had $440,000 (Dh1.6 million) on deposit at the Hong Kong bitcoin exchange Bitfinex until last week and, on good days, would wake up to find a couple thousand more dollars in his account than when he went to sleep. The earnings came from lending his dollars to traders who wanted to leverage their bets. The exchange allowed lenders like Tian to set their own rates, and he says margin traders paid as much as 700 per cent annualised interest to borrow dollars. At times, he earned as much in one day as holders of US Treasuries earn in a decade.“The returns were really great,” Tian said. “Bitfinex was quite innovative and among the first to come out with products including margin lending.”That lucrative practice came to a stunning halt last week after Bitfinex said it was hacked for 119,756 bitcoins, worth about $70 million at current prices. While his US dollars were not stolen, Tian is being forced to forfeit 36 per cent of his deposit”-about $160,000”-as part of a rescue plan the exchange is imposing on all its customers. He said that will more than wipe out the profits he made through lending money.Legal proceedingsBitfinex, which was the largest bitcoin exchange for US dollar trading before the attack, says leaning on its users to cover the loss is the best way to avoid insolvency that would tie up deposits with legal proceedings for years. The exchange hopes to repay the lost money: Customers are receiving tokens that Bitfinex says will one day be redeemable for shares in its parent company, which would give its customers a stake in future profits. Zane Tackett, a director at Bitfinex, said the exchange is also offering to pay anyone who helps recover the bitcoins a reward of 5 per cent of the money, a bounty that could total more than $3 million.The episode has triggered legal consultations and soul-searching among Tian and others like him. Whether they accept the exchange’s offer or fire back with lawsuits will determine the latest chapter in bitcoin’s colourful history.“Some users are still reaching out to lawyers to weigh their options, but going through litigation does mean a lot of risks,” Tian said. “The losses aren’t as bad as I initially expected, but there are still a lot of questions regarding the method of compensation.”Among the unanswered questions: How did Bitfinex calculate the 36 per cent haircut? Is the exchange itself shouldering any losses? What are the legal guarantees that the new tokens will be redeemable in the future? The exchange did not reply to multiple inquiries from Bloomberg. The tokens, which were issued at a total value of about $70 million, immediately fell to about $21 million in their trading debut Thursday on Bitfinex.BankruptcyThe discount suggests little confidence in the exchange’s future. “Bitfinex has to prove that it can survive first,” said Peter Ng, a Hong Kong-based user who is facing more than $200,000 in losses. “We need to see how transparent the company is going forward. If you lose trust, then you lose your customers.”Still, he says he had feared even worse. In February 2014, Tokyo-based Mt Gox”-then the world’s largest bitcoin exchange”-announced that $480 million was stolen by hackers and filed for bankruptcy weeks later. Its users are still waiting for liquidators to return a fraction of the deposits that did not disappear.Litigation against Bitfinex could also drag out since Hong Kong, like most countries, has little legal infrastructure in place for regulating bitcoin exchanges or protecting owners of digital currencies. The city’s central bank has said bitcoin falls outside its authority. KC Chan, the secretary for financial services and the treasury, has said the government doesn’t yet see a need for legislation.Bitcoin exchanges could still face legal liabilities under general anti-money laundering laws, and bitcoin transactions may be subject to rules on commodity trading, according to the law firm Kobre & Kim. Customers may also try to recover funds based on claims of negligence or manipulation on the part of the exchange, according to Jef Klazen, a New York-based partner at the firm.“If your account wasn’t actually hacked but received this 36 per cent haircut, you might be able to pursue a legal claim on the theory that Bitfinex misappropriated your funds because it made a unilateral decision to take money out of your account,” Klazen said. Still, he says a lot will depend on what kind of legal contracts users signed with Bitfinex when opening accounts. He reviewed the terms and conditions on the exchange’s website and thinks that disputes may need to be resolved using an arbitrator selected by the exchange.“Depending on what jurisdiction you’re trying to sue in, a court might view that as foreclosing your ability to pursue a lawsuit,” said Klazen.Margin lendingWhile security experts have stressed for years that users should minimise deposits at bitcoin exchanges”-a painful lesson from Mt. Gox”-many ignored that advice due to Bitfinex’s unique margin lending system. The platform allowed traders to multiply the size of their bets by borrowing money, but the practice required both lenders and borrowers to keep their funds at the exchange. That made it a prime target for hackers. About $38 million was on loan to margin traders immediately before the attack, according to bfxdata.com, a site that tracks activity on Bitfinex.Among those who borrowed heavily is 34-year old Zhuo Shuoji. The Beijing-based trader says his annualised borrowing rates were usually less than ten per cent, but would jump to extraordinary levels when bitcoin volatility rose. Despite the high cost, he says he made good profits until the hack. Now, he just wants to get back whatever money he can.“The key is for us to get our remaining funds back first,” said Zhuo, adding that he is facing about $700,000 in potential losses. “Then we need to see that this exchange can remain in operation for the tokens to have any value.”The risk for Bitfinex is that if too many customers like Zhou pull their money out and don’t come back, profits from trading fees and margin lending will tumble, throwing into question the exchange’s plan to earn back the loss over time. Still, Bitfinex’s ability to begin restoring operations, defend against follow-up attacks, and keep users from completely giving up hope has earned it some credibility.“The way the whole thing was handled is already an improvement compared with older cases where either the exchange went bust or let users shoulder all the loss,” said Tian. “They found a middle way and solutions created could become a road map for the future.”', 'Demian Brener is founder and CEO of Smart Contract Solutions, a firm working to provide tools to build businesses using blockchain-based software tokens.In this opinion piece, Brener discusses the different ways startups are seeking to leverage these new creations, and the various business models taking shape in the evolving space.Companies we\'ve never heard of are launching IPOs before our very eyes.But instead of ringing the IPO bell after years of operations, they are going public on day one, and instead of raising money by selling their company stock, they are building distributed networks and selling their own tokens.This new way of building companies is what Fred Ehrsam , founder of Coinbase , described as the ""decentralized business model"".Yet, many of the established rules about building and investing in businesses don\'t apply to this new model. What can we learn from the companies going down this road?TokensThe mechanics of a token crowdsale are directly related to the kind of token issued.We identified three types of tokens:Debt TokensEquity TokensUser Tokens.User tokensUser tokens , or \'appcoins\' as Naval Ravikant and Balaji Srinivasan have called them, are a form of digital currency needed to access the service provided by the distributed network.As Union Square Venture managing partner Albert Wenger explains, you can think of these as tokens you buy at a fair to get on a ride.In ethereum, for example, you need ether to build distributed apps on the platform. In the case of Sia, a distributed storage system, you need to own Siacoins to store files in the network.User tokens are earned by providing value to these networks.Contributions can take the form of mining, as in bitcoin, ethereum and Sia, or publishing stories, as in Steemit. Since user tokens are on a blockchain, they can be easily redeemed for any local or cryptocurrency.Equity tokensEquity tokens are used to finance the development of the network, but are not needed to access the services provided by the underlying protocol. As its name suggests, we can see \'equity tokens\' as cryptographic shares of a network.In exchange for investment, equity token holders are entitled to ""dividends"" in the form of revenue sharing or transaction fees in the network. For example, in the case of Sia, 3.9% of all successful storage payouts go to the holders of Siafunds, their equity token.In many cases, these equity tokens represent shares of a distributed autonomous organization (DAO). A DAO\'s code is responsible for issuing the tokens, holding the money collected from the token sale, and contracting a company to develop the network.Besides receiving a pro-rated reward, equity token holders in the form of DAO shares are usually entitled to pledge on proposals for how the investment money will be used.That\'s the case of Digix, an asset-tokenisation platform built on ethereum. DGD token holders:Receive a reward on the transaction fees of the Digix Gold Network Are able to submit and vote proposals on the DigixDAO.Debt TokensA third type of token is the \'debt token\'.We can see these as a \'short term loan\' to the network, in exchange for an interest rate on the amount lent. Steemit is one of the few networks with debt tokens, issued in the form of Steem Dollars.Steem, the cryptocurrency mined by the network, can be used to buy Steem Power or Steem Dollars. Holders of Steem Dollars receive a ~10% interest rate, paid in Steem Dollars.Steem Dollars are unique to the economics of the Steemit protocol.Through buying Steem Dollars, people can invest in the network with sufficient liquidity, without committing to the two-year vesting period to which Steem Power holders are subjected.We see networks with multiple combinations.These include networks with:Both user and equity tokens (Sia, Digix)Only user tokens (bitcoin, ethereum)Only equity tokens (Golem, SingularDTV)User, equity and debt tokens (Steemit).The combination depends on the unique dynamics and economics of the network.CrowdsalesThe type of token typically dictates the mechanics of its crowdsale.Pre-sale of User TokensTo sell user tokens, companies tend to:Publish a white paper defining the specifications of the network and a roadmap for its future development. Publicly announce the token and release the source code prior to creating the first token. Deploy the network and secure user tokens via mining. Alternatively, allocate a portion of the pre-sale tokens to the founding team as a reward for ideating and developing the network. Advertise the network and sell user tokens to anyone, anywhere. Work to grow the number of people using, building apps on top and maintaining the network.As the network grows, demand for the token increases, leading to a rise in the user token price. This is what we call the \'Nakamoto business model\'. Satoshi got its reward not by pre-mining bitcoins, but by being the first believer and supporter of the network.Steemit followed the Nakamoto business model as well. The company wrote the code to power the Steemit distributed network, announced it to the public and secured ~80% of the initial STEEM via mining. The project plans to keep 20%, sell 20% to raise money and give away 40% to attract users/referrers.Ethereum’s case is a bit different. Its pre-sale consisted of distributing private keys to buyers as a software access token to use the future network. Ethereum raised over $18m worth of bitcoin in the form of 60m ETH tokens created, where 12m ETH (20%) were retained by the development team.When ethereum launched, buyers received their ether as the first blocks were mined.Crowdsale of equity tokensFor equity tokens, companies tend to:Publish a white paper defining the specifications of the network and a roadmap for its future development. Write a smart contract for a DAO, with a pre-defined number of equity tokens allocated to the company founders. Make the company the provider of the DAO, in charge of developing the network in exchange for a payment. Advertise the DAO crowdsale and sell equity tokens to anyone, anywhere. Use that money to pay the company for their development work. Work to make the network grow to increase the value of the equity token, and collect rewards based on the increased network usage.Digix reached its $5.5m total within 12 hours by following these steps.Since DigixGlobal is the company that ideated the network, published the white paper, wrote the DAO smart contract in ethereum and holds a substantial amount of equity tokens, they became the default service provider of the DigixDAO.Regulation on token crowdsalesThe laws that govern the issuance and sale of cryptographic tokens depend on the jurisdiction in which these events take place.There are countries like Singapore and Switzerland where virtual currencies are not considered securities nor legal tender.In the US, the Howey test is used to evaluate the sale of securities.Under the Howey test, an instrument is a security if it A) involves an investment of money or other tangible or definable consideration used in B) a common enterprise with C) a reasonable expectation of profits to be D) derived primarily from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.The public sale of securities to US citizens is overseen by the SEC, rendering it illegal to perform such an act without its permission.Industry thought leaders, like non-profit advocacy group Coin Center and Harvard Berkman\'s Primavera de Filippi, suggest the issuance of user and equity tokens may constitute the sale of securities under the Howey test. But in reality, the power of these tokens goes beyond our understanding of traditional securities.We also know the SEC is working on ways to rule blockchains as transfer agents. The actual impact of this regulation on the issuance of tokens is still unknown.Connecting tokens to the legacy worldWe see four different approaches used to carry out a legal and compliant token crowdsale.The Swiss-based GmbH and FoundationThe ether pre-sale was conducted by the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization registered in Switzerland, whose sole purpose is managing the funds raised from the ether sale in order to best serve the ethereum ecosystem.To enable US citizens to purchase Ether without being ruled by the SEC, they framed the pre-sale of user tokens as the sale of cryptographic fuel – ether (""ETH"") – required to run distributed applications on the Ethereum open source platform.The initial development of the software was carried out by Ethereum Switzerland GmbH, a Swiss-based LLC.The Singapore company and DAOIn the case of Digix, the smart contract for the DigixDAO was written by DigixGlobal, a Singapore-based company. This company is then hired by the DigixDAO and gets paid for developing the Digix network. Equity tokens sold represent shares of the DigixDAO.While the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) does not consider tokens as securities, the legal sale to US citizens depends on the SEC\'s interpretation of the tokens under the Howey test.The \'CODE\'A third experimental approach used by Singular-DTV – a blockchain entertainment studio – is the ""centrally organized distributed entity"".The ‘CODE’ is a combination of a centrally organized (CO) governance component in the form of a Swiss GmbH – LLC – and a decentralized entity (DE) component in the form of a tokenized ecosystem built on ethereum.In this case, the GmbH is responsible for spending the ether collected in the Decentralized Entity token sale to build media projects and collect the revenue generated. The ‘CODE’ is supposed to be regulatory and tax compliant, protecting the token holders from potential liability.The independent companyThe last approach is to keep the network and issuance of tokens independent from its creator.Tokens are allocated via a computer algorithm that does not specify any specific public keys to receive funds. Following the Nakamoto business model, the network creator secures its share of tokens by being the first miner in the public network. Steemit did this as a Delaware C Corp.The formation of these entities are some of the first approaches tried to legally connect the new model for building companies to the legacy world.As more companies, lawyers and regulators enter the space, we’ll see how they develop.Overall, we see 40-plus companies applying the token-based model to finance protocol development. We believe it could be extended to other types of companies as well.Red tokens image via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

This way, from 2012 - when Bitcoin began to be famous - more films and documentaries related to the cryptocurrency started to appear. The same thing is happening with the Deep Web, or the “virtual Sodom and Gomorrah.” After the Silk Road and Ross Ulbricht case, this hidden part of the web became more popular than ever, and cinema started to gain an interest in telling its own story about the deep, dark web.Since 2014 there have been several good documentaries about this topic: Inside the ‘Dark Web,’ ‘Deep Web’ and now we have a new one: ‘Down the Deep, Dark Web’ by Yval Orr, who Cointelegraph had the pleasure to talk with.He explains how the movie came together:“The idea for ‘Down the Deep, Dark Web’ started in conversation with Itai Landsberg, head of documentaries at Israel's public broadcaster, after he read about the Darknet markets where hackers were selling stolen credit card numbers. [...].

And maybe we should call it Deep Web, as the “dark” adjective may be misleading because “technology has always had two-sides and it depends how you use it” explained Orr during the movie.He says to CoinTelegraph:“Our original goal was to familiarize audiences with the dark net markets for the first time. But as the production progressed we made a really critical switch to focus more on the crypto-anarchists and cypherpunks and to bring their work and words to light and expose audiences to it. So the goal became to engage in a kind of public conversation with these groups whose work has been somewhat hidden from view and to draw in as many people as possible to that conversation.”Orr’s documentary gives viewers the chance to ask themselves important questions related to the compromises people need to accept in exchange for security, as individual freedoms are often compromised against the control of terrorists and criminals.Airports, shopping malls and several other private and public places are full of cameras to track traffic and order, but have you ever thought that we are always filmed and controlled as in George Orwell’s book ‘1984?’Orr concludes:""]","[""Açıklamada, “BTCTurk üzerindeki bakiyeniz hiçbir kesinti olmadan ödenecektir.

The Bitcoin exchange, Bitfinex, says leaning on its users to cover the loss is the best way to avoid insolvency.Tokyo: For years, Tian Jia made the kind of returns on his money that investors in the rest of the world could only dream of.The 29-year-old Beijing-based programmer had $440,000 (Dh1.6 million) on deposit at the Hong Kong bitcoin exchange Bitfinex until last week and, on good days, would wake up to find a couple thousand more dollars in his account than when he went to sleep. The earnings came from lending his dollars to traders who wanted to leverage their bets. The exchange allowed lenders like Tian to set their own rates, and he says margin traders paid as much as 700 per cent annualised interest to borrow dollars. At times, he earned as much in one day as holders of US Treasuries earn in a decade.“The returns were really great,” Tian said. “Bitfinex was quite innovative and among the first to come out with products including margin lending.”That lucrative practice came to a stunning halt last week after Bitfinex said it was hacked for 119,756 bitcoins, worth about $70 million at current prices. While his US dollars were not stolen, Tian is being forced to forfeit 36 per cent of his deposit”-about $160,000”-as part of a rescue plan the exchange is imposing on all its customers. He said that will more than wipe out the profits he made through lending money.Legal proceedingsBitfinex, which was the largest bitcoin exchange for US dollar trading before the attack, says leaning on its users to cover the loss is the best way to avoid insolvency that would tie up deposits with legal proceedings for years. The exchange hopes to repay the lost money: Customers are receiving tokens that Bitfinex says will one day be redeemable for shares in its parent company, which would give its customers a stake in future profits. Zane Tackett, a director at Bitfinex, said the exchange is also offering to pay anyone who helps recover the bitcoins a reward of 5 per cent of the money, a bounty that could total more than $3 million.The episode has triggered legal consultations and soul-searching among Tian and others like him. Whether they accept the exchange’s offer or fire back with lawsuits will determine the latest chapter in bitcoin’s colourful history.“Some users are still reaching out to lawyers to weigh their options, but going through litigation does mean a lot of risks,” Tian said. “The losses aren’t as bad as I initially expected, but there are still a lot of questions regarding the method of compensation.”Among the unanswered questions: How did Bitfinex calculate the 36 per cent haircut? Is the exchange itself shouldering any losses? What are the legal guarantees that the new tokens will be redeemable in the future? The exchange did not reply to multiple inquiries from Bloomberg. The tokens, which were issued at a total value of about $70 million, immediately fell to about $21 million in their trading debut Thursday on Bitfinex.BankruptcyThe discount suggests little confidence in the exchange’s future. “Bitfinex has to prove that it can survive first,” said Peter Ng, a Hong Kong-based user who is facing more than $200,000 in losses. “We need to see how transparent the company is going forward. If you lose trust, then you lose your customers.”Still, he says he had feared even worse. In February 2014, Tokyo-based Mt Gox”-then the world’s largest bitcoin exchange”-announced that $480 million was stolen by hackers and filed for bankruptcy weeks later. Its users are still waiting for liquidators to return a fraction of the deposits that did not disappear.Litigation against Bitfinex could also drag out since Hong Kong, like most countries, has little legal infrastructure in place for regulating bitcoin exchanges or protecting owners of digital currencies. The city’s central bank has said bitcoin falls outside its authority. KC Chan, the secretary for financial services and the treasury, has said the government doesn’t yet see a need for legislation.Bitcoin exchanges could still face legal liabilities under general anti-money laundering laws, and bitcoin transactions may be subject to rules on commodity trading, according to the law firm Kobre & Kim. Customers may also try to recover funds based on claims of negligence or manipulation on the part of the exchange, according to Jef Klazen, a New York-based partner at the firm.“If your account wasn’t actually hacked but received this 36 per cent haircut, you might be able to pursue a legal claim on the theory that Bitfinex misappropriated your funds because it made a unilateral decision to take money out of your account,” Klazen said. Still, he says a lot will depend on what kind of legal contracts users signed with Bitfinex when opening accounts. He reviewed the terms and conditions on the exchange’s website and thinks that disputes may need to be resolved using an arbitrator selected by the exchange.“Depending on what jurisdiction you’re trying to sue in, a court might view that as foreclosing your ability to pursue a lawsuit,” said Klazen.Margin lendingWhile security experts have stressed for years that users should minimise deposits at bitcoin exchanges”-a painful lesson from Mt. Gox”-many ignored that advice due to Bitfinex’s unique margin lending system. The platform allowed traders to multiply the size of their bets by borrowing money, but the practice required both lenders and borrowers to keep their funds at the exchange. That made it a prime target for hackers. About $38 million was on loan to margin traders immediately before the attack, according to bfxdata.com, a site that tracks activity on Bitfinex.Among those who borrowed heavily is 34-year old Zhuo Shuoji. The Beijing-based trader says his annualised borrowing rates were usually less than ten per cent, but would jump to extraordinary levels when bitcoin volatility rose. Despite the high cost, he says he made good profits until the hack. Now, he just wants to get back whatever money he can.“The key is for us to get our remaining funds back first,” said Zhuo, adding that he is facing about $700,000 in potential losses. “Then we need to see that this exchange can remain in operation for the tokens to have any value.”The risk for Bitfinex is that if too many customers like Zhou pull their money out and don’t come back, profits from trading fees and margin lending will tumble, throwing into question the exchange’s plan to earn back the loss over time. Still, Bitfinex’s ability to begin restoring operations, defend against follow-up attacks, and keep users from completely giving up hope has earned it some credibility.“The way the whole thing was handled is already an improvement compared with older cases where either the exchange went bust or let users shoulder all the loss,” said Tian. “They found a middle way and solutions created could become a road map for the future.”', 'Demian Brener is founder and CEO of Smart Contract Solutions, a firm working to provide tools to build businesses using blockchain-based software tokens.In this opinion piece, Brener discusses the different ways startups are seeking to leverage these new creations, and the various business models taking shape in the evolving space.Companies we\'ve never heard of are launching IPOs before our very eyes.But instead of ringing the IPO bell after years of operations, they are going public on day one, and instead of raising money by selling their company stock, they are building distributed networks and selling their own tokens.This new way of building companies is what Fred Ehrsam , founder of Coinbase , described as the ""decentralized business model"".Yet, many of the established rules about building and investing in businesses don\'t apply to this new model. What can we learn from the companies going down this road?TokensThe mechanics of a token crowdsale are directly related to the kind of token issued.We identified three types of tokens:Debt TokensEquity TokensUser Tokens.User tokensUser tokens , or \'appcoins\' as Naval Ravikant and Balaji Srinivasan have called them, are a form of digital currency needed to access the service provided by the distributed network.As Union Square Venture managing partner Albert Wenger explains, you can think of these as tokens you buy at a fair to get on a ride.In ethereum, for example, you need ether to build distributed apps on the platform. In the case of Sia, a distributed storage system, you need to own Siacoins to store files in the network.User tokens are earned by providing value to these networks.Contributions can take the form of mining, as in bitcoin, ethereum and Sia, or publishing stories, as in Steemit. Since user tokens are on a blockchain, they can be easily redeemed for any local or cryptocurrency.Equity tokensEquity tokens are used to finance the development of the network, but are not needed to access the services provided by the underlying protocol. As its name suggests, we can see \'equity tokens\' as cryptographic shares of a network.In exchange for investment, equity token holders are entitled to ""dividends"" in the form of revenue sharing or transaction fees in the network. For example, in the case of Sia, 3.9% of all successful storage payouts go to the holders of Siafunds, their equity token.In many cases, these equity tokens represent shares of a distributed autonomous organization (DAO). A DAO\'s code is responsible for issuing the tokens, holding the money collected from the token sale, and contracting a company to develop the network.Besides receiving a pro-rated reward, equity token holders in the form of DAO shares are usually entitled to pledge on proposals for how the investment money will be used.That\'s the case of Digix, an asset-tokenisation platform built on ethereum.

But as the production progressed we made a really critical switch to focus more on the crypto-anarchists and cypherpunks and to bring their work and words to light and expose audiences to it. So the goal became to engage in a kind of public conversation with these groups whose work has been somewhat hidden from view and to draw in as many people as possible to that conversation.”Orr’s documentary gives viewers the chance to ask themselves important questions related to the compromises people need to accept in exchange for security, as individual freedoms are often compromised against the control of terrorists and criminals.Airports, shopping malls and several other private and public places are full of cameras to track traffic and order, but have you ever thought that we are always filmed and controlled as in George Orwell’s book ‘1984?’Orr concludes:""]"

10/09/2016,"['MGT Capital Investments Inc first announced its debut into the Bitcoin mining business in late June and has reported its mining rewards for Phase One. The Bitcoin operation started when John McAfee, creator of McAfee Antivirus, took over the MGT earlier this year and has steered the company into Bitcoin and Blockchain technology.Marco Streng, CEO of Genesis Mining, spoke to Cointelegraph about MGT’s Bitcoin mining operations:“We appreciate the efforts of MGT going into mining and think it is good for the industry. Since 10 PHs is still a relatively small size operation the direct effect of this for the mining market is rather limited.”How is MGT’s Bitcoin mining different?To date, MGT has mined over 90 Bitcoins so far, at $611 each. At this exchange rate, MGT has earned over $50,000 in mining revenue and is continuing its mining operations. Now, MGT is beginning Phase Two of its mining plans and hopes to reach 5 PetaHash of mining power by the end of 2016’s fourth quarter.It is quite unusual that a company like MGT would invest in a physical Bitcoin mine rather than hold Bitcoin. Most Venture Capital firms just buy and hold Bitcoin in their portfolios but McAfee is taking a different approach.Since MGT is indeed using a massive amount of hardware and their low-cost hydro-power strategy, it seems that it would be more profitable to mine. However, as the reward for Bitcoin blocks mined continues to split, the facility’s fate is sealed by the future Bitcoin price.According to sources, Bitcoin’s next split should be in 2020. This will split the block reward down to 6.25 BTC but the smaller reward will be compensated by Bitcoin’s sky-high value.Next phase is to expand the hashing powerIn MGT’s mining operation announcement, they said that the facility will be in Washington state and generate 2 PetaHash of mining power. Presently, MGT has their facility set up and fully operational. This is all Phase One, Phase Two will be to expand the hashing power.MGT itself reported that they are using new 16 nanometer ASIC chips for high-efficiency mining and “to generate excellent profit margins”.John McAfee, CEO of MGT Capital Investments said:“At our current output, we believe MGT is one of the top five Bitcoin miners in the U.S., and we believe our first quarter 2017 goal of 10 PetaHash for this facility would place MGT in a leadership position in the global Bitcoin network.”So far, it is unsure what McAfee plans to do in the future but he is staying on course to develop Blockchain-based security software and the facility gives MGT the ability to experiment.“I cannot emphasize enough how an operation of this scale provides us with a key competitive advantage for developing security and privacy applications and platforms using the Blockchain,"" added McAfeeThe mining itself, according to McAfee actually brings many financial benefits to the company and its balance sheet, showing decent ROI so far.', '""We were all busy arguing about the block size, but everything else is crucial.""That statement, from Cornell\'s Emin Gün Sirer, may have come in the middle of the second and final day of the Scaling Bitcoin conference, but it was perhaps the overriding theme of the latest edition of the digital currency network\'s developer summit.Despite the public visibility of a protest event scheduled in parallel with the conference, the content of this year\'s event did much to showcase that, for many developers, the ""block size"" is no longer a significant factor in discussions about how the network should increase capacity.Over the course of both days, talks largely moved on to more incremental discussion of the various ""trade-offs"" that should be considered when making changes to bitcoin\'s basic components – and the complex ways they interact.Bitcoin Core developer Eric Lomborozo told CoinDesk:""All engineering requires trade-offs. We\'re trying to figure out the range of possibilities and what trade-offs are more preferable.""Still, Lombrozo acknowledged that the block size (and the pronounced and public feud over whether to change the hard-coded limit to the number of transactions bitcoin can process with each batch of transactions) remains a ""cultural phenomenon"", one its technical community is still trying to move forward from as it navigates a market now dominated by blockchain solutions.The day\'s talks provided a deeper explanation of this subtle change in thinking, with Blockstream principal architect Christopher Allen noting that the social consensus of developers has deemed the block size a non-issue.""I think it was very clear after [the previous conference], which debuted SegWit, that there\'s now a rough consensus of how things are going. The technical community is already a few steps beyond that,"" he explained.Blockstream\'s Greg Sanders emphasized the argument in his morning talk centered on lessons he hopes the community takes away from progress on Segregated Witness, a planned soft fork that will change how transactions are stored by the network and that continues to inch toward implementation.""Let\'s stop talking about the block size. Let\'s talk about weight, the weight of a transaction, the weight of a block, the externalities it puts on the system. Let\'s talk about throughput. We can put more information in small spaces, so let\'s look at these problems,"" Sanders said.Put more flatly, Blockstream\'s Jorge Timón said the block size is simply ""not an interesting topic"".\'Social fork\'Yet while Timón spoke for the majority of attendees surveyed, a vocal minority was still represented at the conference in full force, a development organizing committee member Pindar Wong called a ""social fork"".Investor Roger Ver, a vocal proponent for larger blocks, held a ""Free Speech Party"" on the night of the first event. Attracting roughly 20 guests to a nearby hotel, the event saw the screening of proposals that were rejected from the Scaling Bitcoin conference, as well as discussion on why capacity should be dramatically increased to accommodate more users.That meeting emphasized discussion of a proposal for ""Xthin blocks"", as well as work by researchers to prove how larger bitcoin blocks, as enabled by an alternative proposal called \'Bitcoin Unlimited\', could be executed on the network without increasing the time it takes for the data from those blocks to reach nodes and miners located around the globe.Also voiced were reasons why the initiative should have been considered by the Scaling Bitcoin conference, as well as fears that an alternative digital currency could overtake bitcoin\'s market position. Further, attendees criticized the conference\'s approach as one that was ""not data driven"", while top-level bitcoin scaling initiatives like Lightning were dismissed as ""vaporware"".Bitcoin Unlimited\'s Jerry Chan, who spoke during and attended both events, said he believes the decision to exclude the talk was due to a desire to ""avoid contention at all costs"".""I think that some of the talks that were excluded would have been very useful because they directly address issues that were brought up in the past,"" he said.Perhaps most notable, however, was who the protest event attracted. Major mining sector representatives were in attendance, including Bitmain\'s Jihan Wu and ViaBTC\'s Haipo Yang.Incremental changesElsewhere, the theme of the day\'s talks centered on smaller changes that could be made to the network, and the sometimes intricate side-effects they may have on bitcoin at large.For instance, Blockstream\'s Peter Wiulle gave a talk on Schnorr signatures and how they compare to the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) bitcoin uses to ensure funds are spent by their owners. Still, the talk highlight just how much work would need to happen should even this small tweak to bitcoin\'s gears be considered.""Schnorr signatures are not a standard. ECDSA is a document that exactly specifies all the math that needs to happen,"" Wiulle said. ""Schnorr is a general idea.""With Schnorr signatures, Wiulle presented how the concept is now enabled by SegWit and how it could require only one signature for transactions with multiple inputs, and that only this signature to be sent across the network for the transaction. However, he noted how bitcoin\'s address structure posed a problem for the change, as did new potential attack vectors, leading him to ultimately call for more academic work on the idea.Yet another talk, which look at the performance of proof-of-work blockchains, saw a comparison of block propagation on the bitcoin network and other alternative blockchains.Here, presenter Arthur Gervaise of ETH Zurich reviewed how simulations conducted at the Swiss university show the time between bitcoin blocks, currently set for roughly 10 minutes, could be reduced to 1 minute, while enabling 60 transactions per second safely.That\'s not to say that big ideas were not discussed. Some proposals saw prominent developers, including Peter Todd and David Vorick, overview radically new ways to rethink how bitcoin could work.Particularly notable was Todd\'s talk on scaling via client-side validation. Here, Todd posed the question of whether miners were needed to validate transactions at all, questioning how redefining their relationship with nodes (a fundamental building block) could lead to better scalability.""You can say miners validating is kind of an optimization. It does have some interesting social effects.

Do dnia dzisiejszego przez platformę udzielonych zostało ponad 1400 pożyczek, na łączną sumę wartą blisko 3 000 000 zł.

Należy z powodzeniem przejść weryfikację wideo, polegającą na przedstawieniu swojego dokumentu tożsamości a także przesłać dokumenty potwierdzające adres zamieszkania oraz obecną sytuację finansową (np. wycinek płacy od pracodawcy). Następnym krokiem jest połączenie min. 2 kont internetowych (np. Facebook, LinkedIn, PayPal, eBay). Przede wszystkim na tej podstawie określana jest zdolność kredytowa wnioskodawcy. Następnie, każdy aktywny pożyczkobiorca na platformie otrzymuje swój rating (A – F), który jest oznaczeniem zdolności kredytowej.Perspektywa inwestoraW celu rozpoczęcia inwestowania przez platformę Bitbond, jedynym wymogiem jest weryfikacja online, polegająca na 2-3 minutowej sesji z agentem w celu potwierdzenia swojej tożsamości.

Dostępne jest także narzędzie AutoInvest polegające na automatycznym inwestowaniu według wskazanych kryteriów.W związku z tym, że kurs Bitcoina ulega częstym wahaniom, Bitbond oferuje dwa typy pożyczek w celu uniknięcia ryzyka z tym związanego:A) Pożyczki BTC – pożyczając 1 BTC, pożyczkobiorca oddaje 1 BTC + odsetkiB) Pożyczki USD – w tym przypadku Bitcoin używany jest tylko i wyłącznie jako sieć płatności. Użytkownik biorąc pożyczkę w wysokości 1000 USD, otrzymuje jej ekwiwalent w bitcoinach, po czym należy zwrócić również 1000 USD + odsetki w bitcoinach (niezależnie od kursu Bitcoina w danym momencie).(Trochę o pożyczkach p2p w btc)Koncepcja pożyczek społecznościowych występuje na polskim rynku od paru lat. Polega ona na zawieraniu transakcji bezpośrednio pomiędzy osobami fizycznymi. Inaczej mówiąc jest to udzielanie pożyczek ludziom przez ludzi.Bitcoin umożliwia globalne, transgraniczne udzielanie pożyczek – nie byłoby to możliwe pod względem ekonomicznym z taką walutą, jak chociażby Polski Złoty (PLN). Dla przykładu weźmy pożyczkobiorcę z Brazylii, którego sfinansowali inwestorzy z Polski, Japonii oraz Anglii. Każdy z tych inwestorów musiałby zrobić tradycyjny przelew w swojej lokalnej walucie do Brazylii, co zajęło by co najmniej 1 tydzień i opłaty z tym związane byłyby bardzo wysokie. Bitcoin umożliwia przesłanie funduszy natychmiastowo i globalnie, przy kosztach bliskich 0.Niezależność od tradycyjnego systemu bankowego. Do roku 2017, 3,5 miliarda osób na świecie (ok. 50% populacji) ma mieć dostęp do smartfona z połączeniem internetowym. Liczba ta więc przekroczy liczbę osób, które mają dostęp do tradycyjnych usług bankowych. Celem Bitbond’a jest dotarcie właśnie do tych osób.Opłacalność – W przeciwieństwie do innych platform oferujących pożyczki społecznościowe, Bitbond jest w pełni niezależny od banków. Dzięki temu, opłaty pobierane od użytkowników są znacząco mniejsze niż w przypadku innych serwisów.BezpieczeństwoCo się dzieje gdy pożyczkobiorca nie spłaca pożyczki?„W przypadku trudności ze spłatą, mamy szereg czynności, które wdrażamy w życie z pierwszym dniem opóźnienia z płatnością. Zaczynając od maili, telefonów, listów, a kończąc na agencji windykacyjnej, która operuje na skali światowej. W przypadku odmowy inwestora, jeśli chodzi o partycypację agencji, ujawniamy dane osobowe pożyczkobiorcy w celu rozpoczęcia procedur prawnych na własną rękę - jednakże większość inwestorów zgadza się, ponieważ szansa na odzyskanie funduszy jest znacznie większa za pomocą działań naszego partnera.” – odpowiedział nam Maciej Chudziński, przedstawiciel Bitbond.Co w przypadku, kiedy nieuczciwy pożyczkobiorca ukrywa swoją prawdziwą tożsamość podrobionymi dokumentami i skrywa się np. za siecią TOR?„Na rzeczy typu fałszowane dokumenty, TOR, VPN, czy przeglądanie incognito jesteśmy przygotowani i mocno wyczuleni. Wszystko jest skrupulatnie sprawdzane.”Bidbond wydaje się być świetną i bezpieczną alternatywą dla wielu firm lichwiarskich oferujących szybkie i niekorzystne pożyczki oraz niebezpieczne dla klienta umowy. Również pożyczki oferowane przez banki, przy Bitbond wypadają blado i po prostu niekorzystnie.']","['MGT Capital Investments Inc first announced its debut into the Bitcoin mining business in late June and has reported its mining rewards for Phase One. The Bitcoin operation started when John McAfee, creator of McAfee Antivirus, took over the MGT earlier this year and has steered the company into Bitcoin and Blockchain technology.Marco Streng, CEO of Genesis Mining, spoke to Cointelegraph about MGT’s Bitcoin mining operations:“We appreciate the efforts of MGT going into mining and think it is good for the industry. Since 10 PHs is still a relatively small size operation the direct effect of this for the mining market is rather limited.”How is MGT’s Bitcoin mining different?To date, MGT has mined over 90 Bitcoins so far, at $611 each. At this exchange rate, MGT has earned over $50,000 in mining revenue and is continuing its mining operations. Now, MGT is beginning Phase Two of its mining plans and hopes to reach 5 PetaHash of mining power by the end of 2016’s fourth quarter.It is quite unusual that a company like MGT would invest in a physical Bitcoin mine rather than hold Bitcoin. Most Venture Capital firms just buy and hold Bitcoin in their portfolios but McAfee is taking a different approach.Since MGT is indeed using a massive amount of hardware and their low-cost hydro-power strategy, it seems that it would be more profitable to mine. However, as the reward for Bitcoin blocks mined continues to split, the facility’s fate is sealed by the future Bitcoin price.According to sources, Bitcoin’s next split should be in 2020. This will split the block reward down to 6.25 BTC but the smaller reward will be compensated by Bitcoin’s sky-high value.Next phase is to expand the hashing powerIn MGT’s mining operation announcement, they said that the facility will be in Washington state and generate 2 PetaHash of mining power. Presently, MGT has their facility set up and fully operational. This is all Phase One, Phase Two will be to expand the hashing power.MGT itself reported that they are using new 16 nanometer ASIC chips for high-efficiency mining and “to generate excellent profit margins”.John McAfee, CEO of MGT Capital Investments said:“At our current output, we believe MGT is one of the top five Bitcoin miners in the U.S., and we believe our first quarter 2017 goal of 10 PetaHash for this facility would place MGT in a leadership position in the global Bitcoin network.”So far, it is unsure what McAfee plans to do in the future but he is staying on course to develop Blockchain-based security software and the facility gives MGT the ability to experiment.“I cannot emphasize enough how an operation of this scale provides us with a key competitive advantage for developing security and privacy applications and platforms using the Blockchain,"" added McAfeeThe mining itself, according to McAfee actually brings many financial benefits to the company and its balance sheet, showing decent ROI so far.', '""We were all busy arguing about the block size, but everything else is crucial.""That statement, from Cornell\'s Emin Gün Sirer, may have come in the middle of the second and final day of the Scaling Bitcoin conference, but it was perhaps the overriding theme of the latest edition of the digital currency network\'s developer summit.Despite the public visibility of a protest event scheduled in parallel with the conference, the content of this year\'s event did much to showcase that, for many developers, the ""block size"" is no longer a significant factor in discussions about how the network should increase capacity.Over the course of both days, talks largely moved on to more incremental discussion of the various ""trade-offs"" that should be considered when making changes to bitcoin\'s basic components – and the complex ways they interact.Bitcoin Core developer Eric Lomborozo told CoinDesk:""All engineering requires trade-offs. We\'re trying to figure out the range of possibilities and what trade-offs are more preferable.""Still, Lombrozo acknowledged that the block size (and the pronounced and public feud over whether to change the hard-coded limit to the number of transactions bitcoin can process with each batch of transactions) remains a ""cultural phenomenon"", one its technical community is still trying to move forward from as it navigates a market now dominated by blockchain solutions.The day\'s talks provided a deeper explanation of this subtle change in thinking, with Blockstream principal architect Christopher Allen noting that the social consensus of developers has deemed the block size a non-issue.""I think it was very clear after [the previous conference], which debuted SegWit, that there\'s now a rough consensus of how things are going. The technical community is already a few steps beyond that,"" he explained.Blockstream\'s Greg Sanders emphasized the argument in his morning talk centered on lessons he hopes the community takes away from progress on Segregated Witness, a planned soft fork that will change how transactions are stored by the network and that continues to inch toward implementation.""Let\'s stop talking about the block size. Let\'s talk about weight, the weight of a transaction, the weight of a block, the externalities it puts on the system. Let\'s talk about throughput. We can put more information in small spaces, so let\'s look at these problems,"" Sanders said.Put more flatly, Blockstream\'s Jorge Timón said the block size is simply ""not an interesting topic"".\'Social fork\'Yet while Timón spoke for the majority of attendees surveyed, a vocal minority was still represented at the conference in full force, a development organizing committee member Pindar Wong called a ""social fork"".Investor Roger Ver, a vocal proponent for larger blocks, held a ""Free Speech Party"" on the night of the first event. Attracting roughly 20 guests to a nearby hotel, the event saw the screening of proposals that were rejected from the Scaling Bitcoin conference, as well as discussion on why capacity should be dramatically increased to accommodate more users.That meeting emphasized discussion of a proposal for ""Xthin blocks"", as well as work by researchers to prove how larger bitcoin blocks, as enabled by an alternative proposal called \'Bitcoin Unlimited\', could be executed on the network without increasing the time it takes for the data from those blocks to reach nodes and miners located around the globe.Also voiced were reasons why the initiative should have been considered by the Scaling Bitcoin conference, as well as fears that an alternative digital currency could overtake bitcoin\'s market position. Further, attendees criticized the conference\'s approach as one that was ""not data driven"", while top-level bitcoin scaling initiatives like Lightning were dismissed as ""vaporware"".Bitcoin Unlimited\'s Jerry Chan, who spoke during and attended both events, said he believes the decision to exclude the talk was due to a desire to ""avoid contention at all costs"".""I think that some of the talks that were excluded would have been very useful because they directly address issues that were brought up in the past,"" he said.Perhaps most notable, however, was who the protest event attracted. Major mining sector representatives were in attendance, including Bitmain\'s Jihan Wu and ViaBTC\'s Haipo Yang.Incremental changesElsewhere, the theme of the day\'s talks centered on smaller changes that could be made to the network, and the sometimes intricate side-effects they may have on bitcoin at large.For instance, Blockstream\'s Peter Wiulle gave a talk on Schnorr signatures and how they compare to the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) bitcoin uses to ensure funds are spent by their owners. Still, the talk highlight just how much work would need to happen should even this small tweak to bitcoin\'s gears be considered.""Schnorr signatures are not a standard. ECDSA is a document that exactly specifies all the math that needs to happen,"" Wiulle said. ""Schnorr is a general idea.""With Schnorr signatures, Wiulle presented how the concept is now enabled by SegWit and how it could require only one signature for transactions with multiple inputs, and that only this signature to be sent across the network for the transaction. However, he noted how bitcoin\'s address structure posed a problem for the change, as did new potential attack vectors, leading him to ultimately call for more academic work on the idea.Yet another talk, which look at the performance of proof-of-work blockchains, saw a comparison of block propagation on the bitcoin network and other alternative blockchains.Here, presenter Arthur Gervaise of ETH Zurich reviewed how simulations conducted at the Swiss university show the time between bitcoin blocks, currently set for roughly 10 minutes, could be reduced to 1 minute, while enabling 60 transactions per second safely.That\'s not to say that big ideas were not discussed. Some proposals saw prominent developers, including Peter Todd and David Vorick, overview radically new ways to rethink how bitcoin could work.Particularly notable was Todd\'s talk on scaling via client-side validation. Here, Todd posed the question of whether miners were needed to validate transactions at all, questioning how redefining their relationship with nodes (a fundamental building block) could lead to better scalability.""You can say miners validating is kind of an optimization. It does have some interesting social effects. I can create this rule and a litecoin and bitcoin can exist on the same system,"" Todd theorized.Academic mindshareYet, there was a sense that bitcoin\'s emphasis on fundamentals is perhaps frustrating to academics intrigued by how it could solve larger issues.For example, Sirer\'s talk on an update to his \'Bitcoin Vault\' proposal, in which \'covenants\' would be added to transactions as a way to restrict the risk they could be executed a malicious actor in the event of theft. In a Q&A session, the idea was met with more pointed questions.There was particular disagreement, acknowledged in the talk by Sirer, about how this would compromise the fungibility of individual bitcoins, or the property by which any one bitcoin can be exchanged for any other.

Dostępne jest także narzędzie AutoInvest polegające na automatycznym inwestowaniu według wskazanych kryteriów.W związku z tym, że kurs Bitcoina ulega częstym wahaniom, Bitbond oferuje dwa typy pożyczek w celu uniknięcia ryzyka z tym związanego:A) Pożyczki BTC – pożyczając 1 BTC, pożyczkobiorca oddaje 1 BTC + odsetkiB) Pożyczki USD – w tym przypadku Bitcoin używany jest tylko i wyłącznie jako sieć płatności. Użytkownik biorąc pożyczkę w wysokości 1000 USD, otrzymuje jej ekwiwalent w bitcoinach, po czym należy zwrócić również 1000 USD + odsetki w bitcoinach (niezależnie od kursu Bitcoina w danym momencie).(Trochę o pożyczkach p2p w btc)Koncepcja pożyczek społecznościowych występuje na polskim rynku od paru lat. Polega ona na zawieraniu transakcji bezpośrednio pomiędzy osobami fizycznymi. Inaczej mówiąc jest to udzielanie pożyczek ludziom przez ludzi.Bitcoin umożliwia globalne, transgraniczne udzielanie pożyczek – nie byłoby to możliwe pod względem ekonomicznym z taką walutą, jak chociażby Polski Złoty (PLN). Dla przykładu weźmy pożyczkobiorcę z Brazylii, którego sfinansowali inwestorzy z Polski, Japonii oraz Anglii. Każdy z tych inwestorów musiałby zrobić tradycyjny przelew w swojej lokalnej walucie do Brazylii, co zajęło by co najmniej 1 tydzień i opłaty z tym związane byłyby bardzo wysokie. Bitcoin umożliwia przesłanie funduszy natychmiastowo i globalnie, przy kosztach bliskich 0.Niezależność od tradycyjnego systemu bankowego. Do roku 2017, 3,5 miliarda osób na świecie (ok. 50% populacji) ma mieć dostęp do smartfona z połączeniem internetowym. Liczba ta więc przekroczy liczbę osób, które mają dostęp do tradycyjnych usług bankowych. Celem Bitbond’a jest dotarcie właśnie do tych osób.Opłacalność – W przeciwieństwie do innych platform oferujących pożyczki społecznościowe, Bitbond jest w pełni niezależny od banków. Dzięki temu, opłaty pobierane od użytkowników są znacząco mniejsze niż w przypadku innych serwisów.BezpieczeństwoCo się dzieje gdy pożyczkobiorca nie spłaca pożyczki?„W przypadku trudności ze spłatą, mamy szereg czynności, które wdrażamy w życie z pierwszym dniem opóźnienia z płatnością. Zaczynając od maili, telefonów, listów, a kończąc na agencji windykacyjnej, która operuje na skali światowej. W przypadku odmowy inwestora, jeśli chodzi o partycypację agencji, ujawniamy dane osobowe pożyczkobiorcy w celu rozpoczęcia procedur prawnych na własną rękę - jednakże większość inwestorów zgadza się, ponieważ szansa na odzyskanie funduszy jest znacznie większa za pomocą działań naszego partnera.” – odpowiedział nam Maciej Chudziński, przedstawiciel Bitbond.Co w przypadku, kiedy nieuczciwy pożyczkobiorca ukrywa swoją prawdziwą tożsamość podrobionymi dokumentami i skrywa się np. za siecią TOR?„Na rzeczy typu fałszowane dokumenty, TOR, VPN, czy przeglądanie incognito jesteśmy przygotowani i mocno wyczuleni. Wszystko jest skrupulatnie sprawdzane.”Bidbond wydaje się być świetną i bezpieczną alternatywą dla wielu firm lichwiarskich oferujących szybkie i niekorzystne pożyczki oraz niebezpieczne dla klienta umowy. Również pożyczki oferowane przez banki, przy Bitbond wypadają blado i po prostu niekorzystnie.']"
