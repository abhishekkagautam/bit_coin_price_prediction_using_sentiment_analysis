01/25/2015,"['Adam Ludwin co-founded Chain.com, a bitcoin developer platform. Prior to Chain, Adam was a venture investor in companies including Vine, Slack, Kik, and Paperless Post. In this article, he addresses the distinction between privacy and anonymity in bitcoin.Bitcoin is often described as a way to transact anonymously. But just how anonymous is it?First off, it is useful to draw a basic distinction between anonymity and privacy in the context of financial transactions. We will call a transaction “anonymous” if no one knows who you are. We will call a transaction “private” if what you purchased, and for what amount, are unknown.Let’s draw a simple matrix and locate different kinds of financial transactions within it:Cash or barter are the most intrinsically private and anonymous means of transacting.In the opposite corner are transactions which are neither anonymous nor private. This includes, say, campaign contributions over a certain amount. We may also include in this quadrant credit card transactions: although not public knowledge like a campaign contribution, your identity is nevertheless connected to every purchase you make, and this information is available to the merchant, credit card network, issuing bank, and — if subpoenaed — law enforcement.Certain financial transactions are private but not anonymous; for example, the donor wall at the local art museum, which identifies the names of donors but not the amounts donated.Bitcoin, by contrast, is anonymous but not private: identities are nowhere recorded in the bitcoin protocol itself, but every transaction performed with bitcoin is visible on the distributed electronic public ledger known as the block chain.The anonymity provided by bitcoin is at once a point of attraction and a challenge for financial regulation. As the pace of adoption of the currency grows and as it comes under scrutiny by the legal and financial systems, particularly with regard to compliance with applicable anti-money laundering (AML) statutes and know-your-customer (KYC) controls, its true level of anonymity will become an increasingly closely studied subject.For many users of bitcoin, who access the currency through one of the popular online wallet or exchange services, their participation at the outset entails linking their personal identity to their bitcoin holdings. Bitcoin for these users is effectively no more anonymous than a bank account, although this loss of anonymity takes place at the point of entry into the currency and is not a feature of the bitcoin protocol itself.For those who wish to take advantage of bitcoin’s intrinsic anonymity, they must find an alternative entry point, such as acquiring bitcoin in a private transaction, as compensation for goods or services rendered, or as a reward for mining. Subsequent bitcoin transactions can then be anonymous, since real-world identities are not recorded on the block chain ledger: the only identifying information recorded there are the bitcoin addresses, whose corresponding private keys are held by the owners as proof of ownership.Maintaining one’s anonymity from this point forward, however, is in no way guaranteed: even supposing one manages to acquire bitcoins without giving up personal information, one’s real-world identity can still be discovered in the course of transacting bitcoin within the network. Let’s look at how this can happen.Broadly speaking, deanonymization techniques pursue one of two complementary approaches, having to do with the public nature of the transaction ledger and with the possibility of exposing the IP addresses of the computers originating the transactions.Anonymity and the transaction ledgerThere is no upper limit to the number of addresses a bitcoin holder can control. All one’s bitcoins can be stored in a single address, or they can be dispersed into dozens or even thousands of addresses. Meanwhile, good practice recommends (though does not enforce) that every address be used only once: any amount left over in change from a transaction should not be kept in the old address but moved to a new one. This proliferation of addresses designedly obscures which ones are controlled by a single individual at a single point in time, and makes it difficult to track the flow of funds controlled by that individual over time.It is possible, however, to leverage the perfect transparency of the transaction ledger to reveal spending patterns in the block chain that allow bitcoin addresses to be bundled by user. This is the domain of transaction graph analysis.Transaction graph analysisTransaction graph analysis applies a few tricks and some educated guesswork to link the approximately 57 million transactions taking place between 62 million addresses to a subset of the unique holders of bitcoin. It then allows transactional relationships between these bitcoin holders to be mapped.One basic technique in transaction graph analysis involves transactions with more than one input address. By definition these inputs are controlled by the same person — and if either address appears elsewhere in the block chain then the associated transactions can also be linked to the same person.A second technique takes advantage of the “good practice” mentioned above: if exactly one of the output addresses in a transaction has never appeared in the block chain before, then it is a good bet that the new address is the change address.A third technique looks at the numerical precision of the amounts involved in a transaction. For example, in a transaction generating two outputs corresponding to two new bitcoin addresses, where one of the outputs is, say, 3 BTC and the other is 2.12791 BTC, then it is a very good bet that the first number corresponds to the recipient and the second number to the change. What is the chance, after all, that the change should happen to end up in such a neat figure? The address originating the transaction can thus be linked to the change address with a high degree of confidence. The same analysis can be repeated after converting to major currencies such as USD to find “whole numbers” that might otherwise be hidden in bitcoin-denominated transactions and that enable sender to be distinguished from receiver.Address deanonymization using these methods can be thwarted by sending bitcoins through so-called mixers or tumblers, which take a set of bitcoins and returns another set of the same value (minus a processing fee) with different addresses and transaction histories, thus effectively “laundering” the coins. But these services come with serious caveats. Users must hand over control of their bitcoins and trust the service to return them. Transaction graph analysis can identify use of a mixing service and flag the user as potentially suspicious. Mixers do not work well for very large sums, unless others with similarly large sums happen to be mixing their bitcoins at the same time. Some mixing services do not work as advertised and can be reverse-engineered. Services that operate legally must keep detailed records of how the coins were mixed, which could later be hacked or subpoenaed. And the new bitcoins received might themselves be tainted by illegal activity.Seeding the transaction graphTransaction graph analysis by itself only reveals the imprint of individual agency in the block chain; it does not reveal any real-world identities. For this it is necessary to refer to information not contained in the block chain.A great deal of information linking bitcoin addresses to their identities is available publicly. Businesses accepting bitcoin may place a QR code near a cash register or on a website. Others may announce their bitcoin address through services such as blockchain.info, which identifies the owners of thousands of addresses. Thousands more addresses can be harvested from public email forums when individuals include personal bitcoin addresses in signature lines to posts. This partial knowledge of identities can be combined with the transaction graph to deanonymize a swath of the transaction ledger.Retroactive geolocation is one potential consequence of this deanonymization. Suppose a café accepts bitcoin and uses a fixed address for their over-the-counter transactions. If you are a patron of that establishment, and your bitcoin addresses become associated with your identity, then someone can easily call forth from the block chain a partial record of your personal whereabouts over time.Conversely, suppose someone wanted to link your identity to your bitcoin address, and you happen to mention that you visited the same café for lunch that day. Someone can look up the address used by the café, find the subset of transactions on that address taking place over the lunch hour, and filter the results by price to exclude transactions involving just a hot drink. Perhaps a bit more information on what you had for lunch, and a look at the café’s menu, and the chances of making a successful match are high.Perfect knowledge of the transaction ledger also means that any additional information discovered at a later date can be retroactively applied, allowing further pieces of the identity puzzle to be dropped into place at any time. A single disclosure of identity, even years in the future, and every transaction on that address and those connected to it is compromised.IP address anonymityA complementary source of potentially deanonymizing information is available to every computer that participates in the decentralized transaction network by hosting a bitcoin node. This information is the set of IP addresses of the computers that announce new bitcoin transactions.At the time of writing there are around 6,500 nodes accepting inbound connections from other nodes, and perhaps ten times that number which don’t accept requests for connections. The former maintain connections to several dozen peers on average, while the latter typically have eight peers. Both kinds of nodes generate transactions. Transaction propagation through the node network begins with the computer that first broadcasts the event to its peers, which then forward the event to their peers in an information cascade that usually reaches every node in the network within a few seconds.The simple observation which can be exploited is that, provided one can find a way to connect to a majority of nodes, perhaps by controlling a coordinated sub-network of nodes spread over many devices, the very first node to relay a transaction is on average the originator of that transaction. The risk increases if multiple transactions are relayed from the same IP address. While a small random delay is baked into the transaction propagation protocol to help preserve the anonymity of the original sender, with the proper techniques enough signal is available through the noise to make a positive identification in many cases. And while use of a TOR router offers some measure of protection against IP address discovery, it exposes the user to other potential attacks.An example of this kind of IP address deanonymization made public is blockchain.info, which discloses the IP address of the first node to report a transaction to its servers. The information is only as reliable as the web site’s node connectivity: with a declared 800–900 connected nodes at the time of writing, it is probably not enough to reliably pinpoint the originating IP in all cases.So…How anonymous is bitcoin today? Average users should be aware that it is certainly less anonymous than cash. Meanwhile, dedicated users willing to go through extraordinary lengths can find ways to acquire and use bitcoin anonymously, but the open nature of the transaction ledger and other unknowns leave open the possibility that identities and activities once considered perfectly secure may be revealed at some point down the road.What about the future? As bitcoin adoption continues to increase, it is not out of the question that a technology arms race could arise between anonymizers and deanonymizers: on the one hand, increasingly sophisticated data mining schemes will be developed, possibly combining transaction graph analysis with IP address discovery, to trace the movement of funds in the block chain between individuals and across borders. On the other, improved techniques will be devised to better conceal individual identity and activity.Here there are many unknowns. Will the core bitcoin code be modified to further protect anonymity or to facilitate regulation? Will bitcoin mixing services become pervasive and secure? Will transaction graph analysis reach a degree of sophistication where most user activities can be easily traced? Will an alternative digital currency or side chain arise which tilts the balance for or against anonymity? All we can say with certainty is that bitcoin is still in its infancy and that existing thinking and tools in the area of anonymity are still primitive. We have seen only the opening moves; the endgame has yet to be played.This backgrounder was originally published by Coin Center, a non-profit research and advocacy center focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency technologies such as bitcoin.

Whether it\'s down to external attacks, or internal irregularities as alleged at Mt Gox, it\'s clear that something has to change.When bitcoin wallet Blockchain experienced its own security problems in December, decentralised cryptography expert Emin Gün Sirer noted that the standard security practices among technology companies would not stand up in the bitcoin world.Too much was at stake, he said. Social media companies may hold pictures of your pets, but your bitcoin account holds something more valuable. It seems reasonable that the cryptocurrency world should be held to a higher level of account than, say, Twitter (although a hacked Twitter account can still have pretty devastating results).""We certainly need better security practices, as we have seen from the constant stream of spectacular failures of bitcoin exchanges,"" he told CoinDesk more recently. ""These services have been failing at the rate of one major failure every two months, leaving many distraught people in their paths.""So, if we accept that companies holding real live funds for customers should have higher security standards, what should those standards be?Advice from bankersIf bitcoin companies shouldn\'t be looking to the general technology sector for their security, then they\'ll need to look elsewhere. Perhaps the banking industry might be able to offer some sage advice. Banks have been valiantly trying to stop hackers from pilfering their customers\' data for years. Could bitcoin companies learn something from them? Given JP Morgan Chase\'s recent losses, maybe not.The JP Morgan Chase hack was undeniably bad, but there\'s a key difference between that and a hacked bitcoin account. JP Morgan customers lost personal information, but not money. If a hacker targets your bitcoin account, your funds are gone.Former digital forensics investigator Michael Perklin is president of the CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium (C4), which has developed a certification for cryptocurrency professionals. He argues that bitcoin companies must go beyond even banks in terms of security:""If someone breaks into a bank and someone edits their database to say \'Now I have a million dollars than I have before,\' or they wire transfer funds out of the bank to go to another bank – then all of that is traceable and reversible.""Conversely, he argued that on-blockchain bitcoin transactions aren\'t, as some exchanges and other bitcoin services have found to their cost.""With bitcoin, once you\'ve taken the keys and transferred them someone else, there\'s no way to get them back without relying on traditional law enforcement,"" he warned.If bitcoin companies can\'t look to Silicon Valley or to banks, then where can they look? Perhaps to themselves.""It\'s high time for the exchanges to realize that they are in this together, that a perception that bitcoin is insecure hurts the entire ecosystem, and it\'s in their best interest to establish practices (like the use of strong databases, multisig wallets, real-time proof of reserves, and trustworthy computing) for the entire industry,"" Sirer said.Better software neededOne area where exchanges could improve is software development, argues Charles Hoskinson, cryptography expert and former CEO of Ethereum, who is now working on an educational project around cryptocurrency.""Exchanges need to clean up their acts and create a standards body for proof of solvency, along with smart contracts to regulate behaviour and restore trust, he said, adding that many exchanges are startups with limited resources. ""That\'s the other problem, which is that the software is pretty crummy.""Building secure software is difficult. In 2003, Microsoft froze its entire development cycle for months, and effectively retrained its developers from the ground up to write more secure code. It began outlawing functions in different software libraries, forbidding its developers to use them.Microsoft even designed a whole process, called the Security Development Lifecycle (SDL), to create software that was bulletproof (or, at the very least, contained fewer holes than the average lump of Gruyere).Software development alone is not enough, however (and in Bitstamp\'s case, it isn\'t entirely clear where the vulnerability lay that allowed hackers to steal bitcoins from the company). There are other issues to consider, too, including infrastructure management. Elements such as change control and security patching are crucial for the operation of a secure environment.Internal processes must also get better, experts say. Performing suitable background checks on personnel responsible for keys is one example, argued Perklin.The good news is that some of these secure processes can be hard-wired into the technology used. Multi-signature technology is a good example. You may vet your senior executives responsible for accessing private keys, but having a system that requires several of them to authenticate a transaction would help to minimise, if not entirely eliminate, the risk of corruption and blackmail.Taking care of businessIf they don\'t get their heads around this, the danger for organisations holding peoples\' cryptocurrencies is that they end up having someone else regulate it for them. Too many big thefts may draw interest from policymakers who may take matters into their own hands.""If there are enough customer complaints, regulators might just be compelled to step in with their usual heavy-handed approach,"" said Gun Sirer, adding that he hoped the industry pulls itself together before that happens. ""I\'m in favour of getting the industry to clean up its own act.""There\'s certainly enough money floating into the bitcoin community to pay for some grown-up programmers. CoinDesk\'s State of Bitcoin report in January documented venture capital investments in bitcoin reaching $433m, and $335m of that happened in 2014.

Amateur- und Hobby-Trader werden diese Software aber sicherlich auch ganz nützlich finden.Wer steckt dahinter: Haasbot entstand aus einem privaten Projekt von Stephan Haas heraus. Haas und sein Team haben sich jedoch dazu entschieden die Software auch für den kommerziellen Handel freizugeben. Das Team besteht aus Haas selbst, dem Marketing Manager Phil Donsbach, dem Entwickler Lander Vanhaverbeke und dem Supporter Thei Goodman.Kosten: Den Haasbot gibt es in drei verschiedenen Preisvarianten. Eine dreimonatige “Beginner” Lizenz kostet 0,22 BTC, die “Simple” Lizenz schlägt mit 0,30 BTC zu Buche und die “Advanced” Vollversion kostet 0,45 BTC. Eine Zahlung in Fiat-Währungen (USD, EUR etc.) ist nicht möglich.Verfügbare Sprachen: Englisch, Deutsch, NiederländischRelease Datum: Januar 2015.Zusammenfasung: Der Haasbot 2.0 bietet seinen Nutzer ein breites Spektrum an Einstellungsmöglichkeiten. Gleich zu Beginn kann man zwischen drei verschiedenen Basis-Bots mit unterschiedlichen Vorabeinstellungen wählen. Abhängig von der Lizenz können zudem diverse weitere Bots hinzugefügt werden.CoinDesk Rating: 4.5/5Die BasisAuch wenn der Name Haasbot für einige unter uns bereits vertraut klingen mag, haben manche Bitcoiner vielleicht noch nie von der Software gehört. Bei Haasbot 2.0 handelt es sich mehr um eine Nischensoftware die sich eher an den professionellen Trader als an den Mainstream richtet.Haasbot 2.0 bietet im Vergleich zu der Vorgängerversion Haasbot 1.0 viele neue Features und vor allem am User-Interface (Arbeitsoberfläche) hat sich so einiges getan. Diese ist nun viel benutzerfreundlicher gestaltet und ermöglicht auch dem Laien eine problemlose Navigation.An den Basisfunktionen hat sich nichts geändert und es gibt auch weiterhin drei verschiedenen Basis-Bots:Trade, Arbitrage und Maximum Order. Trade-Bots handeln im Sinne vieler verschiedener technischen Analysen, Sicherheiten und Absicherungen. Mit dem Update auf Version 2.0 kann man nun auch weitere Script-Bots selbst konfigurieren und aus einem Pool diversen neuen Features wählen.Mit der “Advanced Lizenz” kann der Nutzer unendlich viele Bots erstellen und alle Sicherheiten, Absicherungen und Indikatoren Nutzen. Die “Simple Lizenz” ist auf drei Bots aus jeder Kategorie beschränkt, somit insgesamt neun Bots. Die “Beginner Lizenz” hingegen erlaubt es dem Nutzer nur zwei Bots aus einer jeden Kategorie zu erstellen (insgesamt sechs Bots). Auch die Auswahl von Sicherheiten, Indikatoren und Absicherungen ist bei der Simple und Beginner Lizenz beschränkt.Derzeit unterstützt Haasbot 2.0 die Bitcoin-Börsen Bitfinex, Bitstamp, BTC-e, CEX-IO, Cryptsy, Huobi, Kraken und einige kleinere Börsen. Das bietet dem Nutzer die Möglichkeit die Trends auf verschiedenen Börsen zu beobachten und entsprechend vorausschauen zu handeln.AnwendungWie bereits erwähnt richtet sich Haasbot 2.0 an den Mainstream. Die Zielgruppe der Software sind Trader die den Markt bereits verstehen und genau wissen was sie tun. Das bedeutet jedoch nicht, dass Haasbot für den Hobby-Trader unverständlich und somit zu kompliziert ist. Man sollte sich jedoch IMMER dem Risiko bewusst sein, einen Totalverlust zu erleiden!Mit drei verschiedenen Lizenzen, drei unterschiedlichen Standart-Bots und nahezu unendlich vielen Kombinationen von Sicherheiten, Indikatoren und Absicherungen mag ein Laie ohne jegliche Bot Erfahrung jedoch schnell den Überblick verlieren.Haasonline will dieser Problematik jedoch mit einem ausführlichen Wiki, der detaillierte Guidlines beinhaltet, zuvorkommen. Zudem bietet Haasonline ein Support-Forum für Nutzeranfragen und hilfreichen Tipps.Aufgrund der Vielzahl an Einstellungsmöglichkeiten konnten nicht alle Szenarien getestet werden.Installation und SetupDas 2.0 Update hat dem Haasbot einen komplett neuen Look und eine leicht verständliche Benutzeroberfläche verpasst. Der Installationsprozess der web-basierenden Anwendung ist relativ einfach und geht schnell vonstatten. Die Entwickler empfehlen Google Chrome als Standardbrowser für die Nutzung des Bots. Nach der Installation muss der Bot nur noch mit der jeweiligen Lizenz und den jeweiligen API Informationen gefüttert werden. Danach kann es auch schon losgehen.Das übersichtliche Dashboard bietet dem Nutzer in der Browseroberfläche einen guten Überblick über die aktiven Bots und alle möglichen Einstellungen. Nur die mobile Ansicht lässt noch etwas zu wünschen übrig.Die Auswahl der Trade-, Order- und Arbitrage Bots ist ganz einfach, das Setup der Bots jedoch kann, abhängig von der gewünschten Einstellung, eine ganze Weile in Anspruch nehmen.Ein komplett neues Feature der 2.0 Version sind die Script-Bots die allesamt in C# programmierbar sind. Das Setup dieser Bots benötigt verständlicherweise etwas mehr Zeit und Wissen.Der Haasbot 2.0 ist in drei Sprachen (Englisch, Deutsch und Niederländisch) verfügbar und enthält neue Indikatoren wie Elliot Prediction, Fibonacci und IchiClouds.3 verschiedene BotsWie bereits erwähnt bietet Haasbot 2.0 drei verschiedene Arten von vorkonfigurierten Bots.Der Trade-Bot agiert basierend auf die vom Nutzer zuvor vorkonfigurierten Kombination von Indikatoren, Sicherheiten uns Absicherungen auf die Kauf- bzw- Verkaufssignale. Mit diversen Querverweisen wird dann der Kauf bzw. Verkauf ausgeführt. Zudem fragt der Bot vor dem Kauf bzw. Verkauf die zuvor festgelegten Sicherheiten und Absicherung ab.Die am häufigsten verwendeten Sicherungen sind Dynamic Drop Losses und Static Drop Losses, welche den Preis beobachten und bei einem plötzlichem Kursabfall und das Überschreiten eines zuvor festgelegten Schwellenwertes sofort einen Trade ausführen.Basierend auf der Lizenz stehen dem Nutzer zudem eine Reihe von verschiedenen Indikatoren zur Verfügung. Der beliebteste Indikator ist der “Overcome Fee” Indikator. Dieser tätigt nur einen Trade, wenn der Profit über den Gebühren liegt.Order Bots handeln basierend auf zuvor festgelegte Kondition und Aufträge. Order-Bots können maßgeschneidert und nach den Wünschen des Users eingerichtet werden.

The $58m investment prices the company at close to $1bn, according to people familiar with the deal. Ben Horowitz, a founding partner of Andreessen Horowitz and an ardent advocate of financial innovations such as bitcoin, led the group’s rare investment in a European company and will take a seat on TransferWise’s board — his first for a start-up in the region. The news marks part of a turnround in the tech sector in the UK and Europe, which Silicon Valley investors have tended to shun in preference for the plentiful fast-growing companies on their home turf. Recently, they have shown an increasing appetite to invest across the Atlantic, with European start-up investments involving US groups estimated to be about $3.5bn in 2014, up from just $808m in 2010, according to Go4Venture Advisers, an analyst group. Google launched a venture arm last year with a mandate to invest $100m a year in European companies. Start-ups such as Shazam, a London-based music app, Adyen, a payments processor based in Amsterdam, and TrueCaller, a Swedish phonebook app, have all raised significant sums in the last six months. The investment in TransferWise comes after the Financial Times reported that Sequoia, another Silicon Valley venture capital group, was leading talks over a $50m funding round in November that would value TransferWise close to $1bn. The choice of investor came down largely to who would give the company a more generous valuation, according to people familiar with the deal. Four-year-old TransferWise was founded by early employees of Skype, and lets people send money to one another internationally in 39 countries. The company said it would use the funds to expand into the US, Germany and Australia. Its target market is young professionals and small companies sending salaries across borders — marking it out from some of other London-based money transfer start-ups such as WorldRemit and Azimo, that are more focused on migrant remittances. TransferWise said in November that its business was growing 20 to 30 per cent a month, although in a blog post due to be published on Monday Mr Horowitz indicated that figure was now 15 to 20 per cent a month. Other investors in the latest funding round included existing backers such as Richard Branson, Index Ventures, Valar Ventures and IA Ventures. Andreessen Horowitz’s investment “shows how ripe financial services are for disruption”, said Taavet Hinrikus, TransferWise’s chief executive and co-founder. “For too long, legacy providers’ dominance of the market has allowed consumers to be hoodwinked into paying huge hidden charges for services as basic as currency exchange.” Financial technology is becoming increasingly competitive, with start-ups unburdened by old legacy systems using cloud computing and mobile technology to undercut traditional players on pricing, as well as providing a more personalised experience. The sector is particularly strong in the UK, partly thanks to a favourable timezone, a less fragmented regulatory environment than in the US, and the presence of many global banks. But in the race for market share TransferWise also encountered problems. It fell foul of the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority last year over an advertising campaign claiming that banks were “secretly overcharging” consumers on international transfers, after which the company rebranded itself.']","['Adam Ludwin co-founded Chain.com, a bitcoin developer platform. Prior to Chain, Adam was a venture investor in companies including Vine, Slack, Kik, and Paperless Post. In this article, he addresses the distinction between privacy and anonymity in bitcoin.Bitcoin is often described as a way to transact anonymously. But just how anonymous is it?First off, it is useful to draw a basic distinction between anonymity and privacy in the context of financial transactions. We will call a transaction “anonymous” if no one knows who you are. We will call a transaction “private” if what you purchased, and for what amount, are unknown.Let’s draw a simple matrix and locate different kinds of financial transactions within it:Cash or barter are the most intrinsically private and anonymous means of transacting.In the opposite corner are transactions which are neither anonymous nor private. This includes, say, campaign contributions over a certain amount. We may also include in this quadrant credit card transactions: although not public knowledge like a campaign contribution, your identity is nevertheless connected to every purchase you make, and this information is available to the merchant, credit card network, issuing bank, and — if subpoenaed — law enforcement.Certain financial transactions are private but not anonymous; for example, the donor wall at the local art museum, which identifies the names of donors but not the amounts donated.Bitcoin, by contrast, is anonymous but not private: identities are nowhere recorded in the bitcoin protocol itself, but every transaction performed with bitcoin is visible on the distributed electronic public ledger known as the block chain.The anonymity provided by bitcoin is at once a point of attraction and a challenge for financial regulation. As the pace of adoption of the currency grows and as it comes under scrutiny by the legal and financial systems, particularly with regard to compliance with applicable anti-money laundering (AML) statutes and know-your-customer (KYC) controls, its true level of anonymity will become an increasingly closely studied subject.For many users of bitcoin, who access the currency through one of the popular online wallet or exchange services, their participation at the outset entails linking their personal identity to their bitcoin holdings. Bitcoin for these users is effectively no more anonymous than a bank account, although this loss of anonymity takes place at the point of entry into the currency and is not a feature of the bitcoin protocol itself.For those who wish to take advantage of bitcoin’s intrinsic anonymity, they must find an alternative entry point, such as acquiring bitcoin in a private transaction, as compensation for goods or services rendered, or as a reward for mining. Subsequent bitcoin transactions can then be anonymous, since real-world identities are not recorded on the block chain ledger: the only identifying information recorded there are the bitcoin addresses, whose corresponding private keys are held by the owners as proof of ownership.Maintaining one’s anonymity from this point forward, however, is in no way guaranteed: even supposing one manages to acquire bitcoins without giving up personal information, one’s real-world identity can still be discovered in the course of transacting bitcoin within the network. Let’s look at how this can happen.Broadly speaking, deanonymization techniques pursue one of two complementary approaches, having to do with the public nature of the transaction ledger and with the possibility of exposing the IP addresses of the computers originating the transactions.Anonymity and the transaction ledgerThere is no upper limit to the number of addresses a bitcoin holder can control. All one’s bitcoins can be stored in a single address, or they can be dispersed into dozens or even thousands of addresses. Meanwhile, good practice recommends (though does not enforce) that every address be used only once: any amount left over in change from a transaction should not be kept in the old address but moved to a new one. This proliferation of addresses designedly obscures which ones are controlled by a single individual at a single point in time, and makes it difficult to track the flow of funds controlled by that individual over time.It is possible, however, to leverage the perfect transparency of the transaction ledger to reveal spending patterns in the block chain that allow bitcoin addresses to be bundled by user. This is the domain of transaction graph analysis.Transaction graph analysisTransaction graph analysis applies a few tricks and some educated guesswork to link the approximately 57 million transactions taking place between 62 million addresses to a subset of the unique holders of bitcoin. It then allows transactional relationships between these bitcoin holders to be mapped.One basic technique in transaction graph analysis involves transactions with more than one input address. By definition these inputs are controlled by the same person — and if either address appears elsewhere in the block chain then the associated transactions can also be linked to the same person.A second technique takes advantage of the “good practice” mentioned above: if exactly one of the output addresses in a transaction has never appeared in the block chain before, then it is a good bet that the new address is the change address.A third technique looks at the numerical precision of the amounts involved in a transaction. For example, in a transaction generating two outputs corresponding to two new bitcoin addresses, where one of the outputs is, say, 3 BTC and the other is 2.12791 BTC, then it is a very good bet that the first number corresponds to the recipient and the second number to the change. What is the chance, after all, that the change should happen to end up in such a neat figure? The address originating the transaction can thus be linked to the change address with a high degree of confidence. The same analysis can be repeated after converting to major currencies such as USD to find “whole numbers” that might otherwise be hidden in bitcoin-denominated transactions and that enable sender to be distinguished from receiver.Address deanonymization using these methods can be thwarted by sending bitcoins through so-called mixers or tumblers, which take a set of bitcoins and returns another set of the same value (minus a processing fee) with different addresses and transaction histories, thus effectively “laundering” the coins. But these services come with serious caveats. Users must hand over control of their bitcoins and trust the service to return them. Transaction graph analysis can identify use of a mixing service and flag the user as potentially suspicious. Mixers do not work well for very large sums, unless others with similarly large sums happen to be mixing their bitcoins at the same time. Some mixing services do not work as advertised and can be reverse-engineered. Services that operate legally must keep detailed records of how the coins were mixed, which could later be hacked or subpoenaed. And the new bitcoins received might themselves be tainted by illegal activity.Seeding the transaction graphTransaction graph analysis by itself only reveals the imprint of individual agency in the block chain; it does not reveal any real-world identities. For this it is necessary to refer to information not contained in the block chain.A great deal of information linking bitcoin addresses to their identities is available publicly. Businesses accepting bitcoin may place a QR code near a cash register or on a website. Others may announce their bitcoin address through services such as blockchain.info, which identifies the owners of thousands of addresses. Thousands more addresses can be harvested from public email forums when individuals include personal bitcoin addresses in signature lines to posts. This partial knowledge of identities can be combined with the transaction graph to deanonymize a swath of the transaction ledger.Retroactive geolocation is one potential consequence of this deanonymization. Suppose a café accepts bitcoin and uses a fixed address for their over-the-counter transactions. If you are a patron of that establishment, and your bitcoin addresses become associated with your identity, then someone can easily call forth from the block chain a partial record of your personal whereabouts over time.Conversely, suppose someone wanted to link your identity to your bitcoin address, and you happen to mention that you visited the same café for lunch that day. Someone can look up the address used by the café, find the subset of transactions on that address taking place over the lunch hour, and filter the results by price to exclude transactions involving just a hot drink. Perhaps a bit more information on what you had for lunch, and a look at the café’s menu, and the chances of making a successful match are high.Perfect knowledge of the transaction ledger also means that any additional information discovered at a later date can be retroactively applied, allowing further pieces of the identity puzzle to be dropped into place at any time. A single disclosure of identity, even years in the future, and every transaction on that address and those connected to it is compromised.IP address anonymityA complementary source of potentially deanonymizing information is available to every computer that participates in the decentralized transaction network by hosting a bitcoin node. This information is the set of IP addresses of the computers that announce new bitcoin transactions.At the time of writing there are around 6,500 nodes accepting inbound connections from other nodes, and perhaps ten times that number which don’t accept requests for connections. The former maintain connections to several dozen peers on average, while the latter typically have eight peers. Both kinds of nodes generate transactions. Transaction propagation through the node network begins with the computer that first broadcasts the event to its peers, which then forward the event to their peers in an information cascade that usually reaches every node in the network within a few seconds.The simple observation which can be exploited is that, provided one can find a way to connect to a majority of nodes, perhaps by controlling a coordinated sub-network of nodes spread over many devices, the very first node to relay a transaction is on average the originator of that transaction. The risk increases if multiple transactions are relayed from the same IP address. While a small random delay is baked into the transaction propagation protocol to help preserve the anonymity of the original sender, with the proper techniques enough signal is available through the noise to make a positive identification in many cases. And while use of a TOR router offers some measure of protection against IP address discovery, it exposes the user to other potential attacks.An example of this kind of IP address deanonymization made public is blockchain.info, which discloses the IP address of the first node to report a transaction to its servers. The information is only as reliable as the web site’s node connectivity: with a declared 800–900 connected nodes at the time of writing, it is probably not enough to reliably pinpoint the originating IP in all cases.So…How anonymous is bitcoin today? Average users should be aware that it is certainly less anonymous than cash. Meanwhile, dedicated users willing to go through extraordinary lengths can find ways to acquire and use bitcoin anonymously, but the open nature of the transaction ledger and other unknowns leave open the possibility that identities and activities once considered perfectly secure may be revealed at some point down the road.What about the future? As bitcoin adoption continues to increase, it is not out of the question that a technology arms race could arise between anonymizers and deanonymizers: on the one hand, increasingly sophisticated data mining schemes will be developed, possibly combining transaction graph analysis with IP address discovery, to trace the movement of funds in the block chain between individuals and across borders. On the other, improved techniques will be devised to better conceal individual identity and activity.Here there are many unknowns. Will the core bitcoin code be modified to further protect anonymity or to facilitate regulation? Will bitcoin mixing services become pervasive and secure? Will transaction graph analysis reach a degree of sophistication where most user activities can be easily traced? Will an alternative digital currency or side chain arise which tilts the balance for or against anonymity? All we can say with certainty is that bitcoin is still in its infancy and that existing thinking and tools in the area of anonymity are still primitive. We have seen only the opening moves; the endgame has yet to be played.This backgrounder was originally published by Coin Center, a non-profit research and advocacy center focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency technologies such as bitcoin.

Whether it\'s down to external attacks, or internal irregularities as alleged at Mt Gox, it\'s clear that something has to change.When bitcoin wallet Blockchain experienced its own security problems in December, decentralised cryptography expert Emin Gün Sirer noted that the standard security practices among technology companies would not stand up in the bitcoin world.Too much was at stake, he said. Social media companies may hold pictures of your pets, but your bitcoin account holds something more valuable. It seems reasonable that the cryptocurrency world should be held to a higher level of account than, say, Twitter (although a hacked Twitter account can still have pretty devastating results).""We certainly need better security practices, as we have seen from the constant stream of spectacular failures of bitcoin exchanges,"" he told CoinDesk more recently. ""These services have been failing at the rate of one major failure every two months, leaving many distraught people in their paths.""So, if we accept that companies holding real live funds for customers should have higher security standards, what should those standards be?Advice from bankersIf bitcoin companies shouldn\'t be looking to the general technology sector for their security, then they\'ll need to look elsewhere. Perhaps the banking industry might be able to offer some sage advice. Banks have been valiantly trying to stop hackers from pilfering their customers\' data for years. Could bitcoin companies learn something from them? Given JP Morgan Chase\'s recent losses, maybe not.The JP Morgan Chase hack was undeniably bad, but there\'s a key difference between that and a hacked bitcoin account. JP Morgan customers lost personal information, but not money. If a hacker targets your bitcoin account, your funds are gone.Former digital forensics investigator Michael Perklin is president of the CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium (C4), which has developed a certification for cryptocurrency professionals. He argues that bitcoin companies must go beyond even banks in terms of security:""If someone breaks into a bank and someone edits their database to say \'Now I have a million dollars than I have before,\' or they wire transfer funds out of the bank to go to another bank – then all of that is traceable and reversible.""Conversely, he argued that on-blockchain bitcoin transactions aren\'t, as some exchanges and other bitcoin services have found to their cost.""With bitcoin, once you\'ve taken the keys and transferred them someone else, there\'s no way to get them back without relying on traditional law enforcement,"" he warned.If bitcoin companies can\'t look to Silicon Valley or to banks, then where can they look? Perhaps to themselves.""It\'s high time for the exchanges to realize that they are in this together, that a perception that bitcoin is insecure hurts the entire ecosystem, and it\'s in their best interest to establish practices (like the use of strong databases, multisig wallets, real-time proof of reserves, and trustworthy computing) for the entire industry,"" Sirer said.Better software neededOne area where exchanges could improve is software development, argues Charles Hoskinson, cryptography expert and former CEO of Ethereum, who is now working on an educational project around cryptocurrency.""Exchanges need to clean up their acts and create a standards body for proof of solvency, along with smart contracts to regulate behaviour and restore trust, he said, adding that many exchanges are startups with limited resources. ""That\'s the other problem, which is that the software is pretty crummy.""Building secure software is difficult. In 2003, Microsoft froze its entire development cycle for months, and effectively retrained its developers from the ground up to write more secure code. It began outlawing functions in different software libraries, forbidding its developers to use them.Microsoft even designed a whole process, called the Security Development Lifecycle (SDL), to create software that was bulletproof (or, at the very least, contained fewer holes than the average lump of Gruyere).Software development alone is not enough, however (and in Bitstamp\'s case, it isn\'t entirely clear where the vulnerability lay that allowed hackers to steal bitcoins from the company). There are other issues to consider, too, including infrastructure management. Elements such as change control and security patching are crucial for the operation of a secure environment.Internal processes must also get better, experts say. Performing suitable background checks on personnel responsible for keys is one example, argued Perklin.The good news is that some of these secure processes can be hard-wired into the technology used. Multi-signature technology is a good example. You may vet your senior executives responsible for accessing private keys, but having a system that requires several of them to authenticate a transaction would help to minimise, if not entirely eliminate, the risk of corruption and blackmail.Taking care of businessIf they don\'t get their heads around this, the danger for organisations holding peoples\' cryptocurrencies is that they end up having someone else regulate it for them. Too many big thefts may draw interest from policymakers who may take matters into their own hands.""If there are enough customer complaints, regulators might just be compelled to step in with their usual heavy-handed approach,"" said Gun Sirer, adding that he hoped the industry pulls itself together before that happens. ""I\'m in favour of getting the industry to clean up its own act.""There\'s certainly enough money floating into the bitcoin community to pay for some grown-up programmers. CoinDesk\'s State of Bitcoin report in January documented venture capital investments in bitcoin reaching $433m, and $335m of that happened in 2014. That\'s a lot of salaries for technical security leads.Search image via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Gleich zu Beginn kann man zwischen drei verschiedenen Basis-Bots mit unterschiedlichen Vorabeinstellungen wählen. Abhängig von der Lizenz können zudem diverse weitere Bots hinzugefügt werden.CoinDesk Rating: 4.5/5Die BasisAuch wenn der Name Haasbot für einige unter uns bereits vertraut klingen mag, haben manche Bitcoiner vielleicht noch nie von der Software gehört. Bei Haasbot 2.0 handelt es sich mehr um eine Nischensoftware die sich eher an den professionellen Trader als an den Mainstream richtet.Haasbot 2.0 bietet im Vergleich zu der Vorgängerversion Haasbot 1.0 viele neue Features und vor allem am User-Interface (Arbeitsoberfläche) hat sich so einiges getan. Diese ist nun viel benutzerfreundlicher gestaltet und ermöglicht auch dem Laien eine problemlose Navigation.An den Basisfunktionen hat sich nichts geändert und es gibt auch weiterhin drei verschiedenen Basis-Bots:Trade, Arbitrage und Maximum Order. Trade-Bots handeln im Sinne vieler verschiedener technischen Analysen, Sicherheiten und Absicherungen. Mit dem Update auf Version 2.0 kann man nun auch weitere Script-Bots selbst konfigurieren und aus einem Pool diversen neuen Features wählen.Mit der “Advanced Lizenz” kann der Nutzer unendlich viele Bots erstellen und alle Sicherheiten, Absicherungen und Indikatoren Nutzen. Die “Simple Lizenz” ist auf drei Bots aus jeder Kategorie beschränkt, somit insgesamt neun Bots. Die “Beginner Lizenz” hingegen erlaubt es dem Nutzer nur zwei Bots aus einer jeden Kategorie zu erstellen (insgesamt sechs Bots). Auch die Auswahl von Sicherheiten, Indikatoren und Absicherungen ist bei der Simple und Beginner Lizenz beschränkt.Derzeit unterstützt Haasbot 2.0 die Bitcoin-Börsen Bitfinex, Bitstamp, BTC-e, CEX-IO, Cryptsy, Huobi, Kraken und einige kleinere Börsen. Das bietet dem Nutzer die Möglichkeit die Trends auf verschiedenen Börsen zu beobachten und entsprechend vorausschauen zu handeln.AnwendungWie bereits erwähnt richtet sich Haasbot 2.0 an den Mainstream. Die Zielgruppe der Software sind Trader die den Markt bereits verstehen und genau wissen was sie tun. Das bedeutet jedoch nicht, dass Haasbot für den Hobby-Trader unverständlich und somit zu kompliziert ist. Man sollte sich jedoch IMMER dem Risiko bewusst sein, einen Totalverlust zu erleiden!Mit drei verschiedenen Lizenzen, drei unterschiedlichen Standart-Bots und nahezu unendlich vielen Kombinationen von Sicherheiten, Indikatoren und Absicherungen mag ein Laie ohne jegliche Bot Erfahrung jedoch schnell den Überblick verlieren.Haasonline will dieser Problematik jedoch mit einem ausführlichen Wiki, der detaillierte Guidlines beinhaltet, zuvorkommen. Zudem bietet Haasonline ein Support-Forum für Nutzeranfragen und hilfreichen Tipps.Aufgrund der Vielzahl an Einstellungsmöglichkeiten konnten nicht alle Szenarien getestet werden.Installation und SetupDas 2.0 Update hat dem Haasbot einen komplett neuen Look und eine leicht verständliche Benutzeroberfläche verpasst. Der Installationsprozess der web-basierenden Anwendung ist relativ einfach und geht schnell vonstatten. Die Entwickler empfehlen Google Chrome als Standardbrowser für die Nutzung des Bots. Nach der Installation muss der Bot nur noch mit der jeweiligen Lizenz und den jeweiligen API Informationen gefüttert werden. Danach kann es auch schon losgehen.Das übersichtliche Dashboard bietet dem Nutzer in der Browseroberfläche einen guten Überblick über die aktiven Bots und alle möglichen Einstellungen. Nur die mobile Ansicht lässt noch etwas zu wünschen übrig.Die Auswahl der Trade-, Order- und Arbitrage Bots ist ganz einfach, das Setup der Bots jedoch kann, abhängig von der gewünschten Einstellung, eine ganze Weile in Anspruch nehmen.Ein komplett neues Feature der 2.0 Version sind die Script-Bots die allesamt in C# programmierbar sind. Das Setup dieser Bots benötigt verständlicherweise etwas mehr Zeit und Wissen.Der Haasbot 2.0 ist in drei Sprachen (Englisch, Deutsch und Niederländisch) verfügbar und enthält neue Indikatoren wie Elliot Prediction, Fibonacci und IchiClouds.3 verschiedene BotsWie bereits erwähnt bietet Haasbot 2.0 drei verschiedene Arten von vorkonfigurierten Bots.Der Trade-Bot agiert basierend auf die vom Nutzer zuvor vorkonfigurierten Kombination von Indikatoren, Sicherheiten uns Absicherungen auf die Kauf- bzw- Verkaufssignale. Mit diversen Querverweisen wird dann der Kauf bzw. Verkauf ausgeführt. Zudem fragt der Bot vor dem Kauf bzw. Verkauf die zuvor festgelegten Sicherheiten und Absicherung ab.Die am häufigsten verwendeten Sicherungen sind Dynamic Drop Losses und Static Drop Losses, welche den Preis beobachten und bei einem plötzlichem Kursabfall und das Überschreiten eines zuvor festgelegten Schwellenwertes sofort einen Trade ausführen.Basierend auf der Lizenz stehen dem Nutzer zudem eine Reihe von verschiedenen Indikatoren zur Verfügung. Der beliebteste Indikator ist der “Overcome Fee” Indikator. Dieser tätigt nur einen Trade, wenn der Profit über den Gebühren liegt.Order Bots handeln basierend auf zuvor festgelegte Kondition und Aufträge. Order-Bots können maßgeschneidert und nach den Wünschen des Users eingerichtet werden. Somit hat der Nutzer die Möglichkeit verschiedene Konditionen in nur einem Bot zu vereinen und eine Unterstützung oder einen Widerstand zu emulieren.Arbitrage-Bots können auf Bitcoin-Börsen angewendet werden die den Handel in verschiedenen Währungen erlauben. Damit kann der Nutzer sogar Profit aus Währungsschwankungen schlagen. In einem solchen Szenario wird der Bot auf eine bestimmte Basis-Währung konfiguriert und sobald er eine Währungsschwankung feststellt, wird ein entsprechender Trade ausgeführt. Dies sind auch sogenannte Low-Risk Trades (niedriges Risiko).Konfiguration der BotsEs gibt unzählige Möglichkeiten die Bots zu konfigurieren.

The $58m investment prices the company at close to $1bn, according to people familiar with the deal. Ben Horowitz, a founding partner of Andreessen Horowitz and an ardent advocate of financial innovations such as bitcoin, led the group’s rare investment in a European company and will take a seat on TransferWise’s board — his first for a start-up in the region. The news marks part of a turnround in the tech sector in the UK and Europe, which Silicon Valley investors have tended to shun in preference for the plentiful fast-growing companies on their home turf. Recently, they have shown an increasing appetite to invest across the Atlantic, with European start-up investments involving US groups estimated to be about $3.5bn in 2014, up from just $808m in 2010, according to Go4Venture Advisers, an analyst group. Google launched a venture arm last year with a mandate to invest $100m a year in European companies. Start-ups such as Shazam, a London-based music app, Adyen, a payments processor based in Amsterdam, and TrueCaller, a Swedish phonebook app, have all raised significant sums in the last six months. The investment in TransferWise comes after the Financial Times reported that Sequoia, another Silicon Valley venture capital group, was leading talks over a $50m funding round in November that would value TransferWise close to $1bn.

The company said it would use the funds to expand into the US, Germany and Australia. Its target market is young professionals and small companies sending salaries across borders — marking it out from some of other London-based money transfer start-ups such as WorldRemit and Azimo, that are more focused on migrant remittances. TransferWise said in November that its business was growing 20 to 30 per cent a month, although in a blog post due to be published on Monday Mr Horowitz indicated that figure was now 15 to 20 per cent a month. Other investors in the latest funding round included existing backers such as Richard Branson, Index Ventures, Valar Ventures and IA Ventures. Andreessen Horowitz’s investment “shows how ripe financial services are for disruption”, said Taavet Hinrikus, TransferWise’s chief executive and co-founder. “For too long, legacy providers’ dominance of the market has allowed consumers to be hoodwinked into paying huge hidden charges for services as basic as currency exchange.” Financial technology is becoming increasingly competitive, with start-ups unburdened by old legacy systems using cloud computing and mobile technology to undercut traditional players on pricing, as well as providing a more personalised experience. The sector is particularly strong in the UK, partly thanks to a favourable timezone, a less fragmented regulatory environment than in the US, and the presence of many global banks. But in the race for market share TransferWise also encountered problems. It fell foul of the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority last year over an advertising campaign claiming that banks were “secretly overcharging” consumers on international transfers, after which the company rebranded itself.']"

02/06/2015,"[""In perhaps one of the more surprising interview statements from the banking industry, ex-CEO of UBS and Credit Suisse Oswald Gruebel has openly voiced his support for Bitcoin and distrust of fiat currency.Speaking to Cash.ch, Gruebel criticized the inability of banks to prevent economic crises, while championing gold and Bitcoin as credible long-term investment opportunities.Gruebel said:“The only investment that demonstrably keeps its value over a long period is gold, and in future perhaps also bitcoins.”The context surrounding Gruebel’s admission highlights how unexpected his words were. Despite having a fairly open policy towards digital currency industry, Switzerland, the banking capital of Europe, has seen some particularly vehement – and high profile – opposition.Only two months ago, Citibank released a report as part of its retaliation against the Save Our Swiss Gold initiative, describing Bitcoin as being “without intrinsic value,” “costly to produce and store” and even “fiat currency.” The Swiss National Bank (SNB) also shied away from gold itself ahead of the initiative-backed referendum on repatriation of Switzerland’s gold reserves.A counterargument from one of banking’s former major players highlights misalignment within the industry.“Take the total assets of the SNB. In the shortest of periods they went from being worth 50 billion francs to 550 billion. I'm amazed that people were able just to accept that.”Gruebel stated that bank weakness would continue to have an increasing detrimental effect on the global economy.“Capital requirements mean that in future, banks will no longer be in a position to take advantage of their position as market makers,” he explained. “That means that they'll no longer be buying when rates sink, and no longer be selling when they rise. It simply costs too much in terms of capital... Therefore markets can tumble a lot faster than in the past...”Regulators also tellingly came in for criticism.“When I went to Credit Suisse in 2007, regulators told me, ‘Your risk management at CS is a lot worse than at UBS,’” he added. “A year later this was rebutted. There you can see how regulators can fool you.”Gruebel’s statements on Bitcoin were immediately lauded by many in the digital currency community, but as yet no supporting evidence has been had to indicate his true openness towards Bitcoin’s propagation domestically or internationally. One thing for certain, however, is Gruebel’s aversion to money-printing, which comes as little surprise from one of banking’s wealthier veterans. He concluded:“Central banks can print money limitlessly and these days they are telling us that openly. It's therefore no longer recoverable.”Did you enjoy this article?

Silk Road supporters claim that the Silk Road site made it possible for customers to procure so-called “victimless crimes.” But as everyone knows about the drug trade, it’s a violent market. And, as the Silk Road trial transcripts illustrate, when that trade turns onto the Deep Web it can get even darker. And then add bitcoins — the supposed untraceable currency — and you have the perfect environment for dialogue that you might only ever find on TV.Check out what was supposed to be a secret conversation between Dread Pirate Roberts and the alleged hitman connection.DPR: “Not long ago, I had a clean hit done for $80k. …I’ve only ever commissioned the one other hit, so I’m still learning this market.”DPR: “The exchange rate is above $90 right now, so at $90/[bitcoin], $150k is about 1670 [bitcoin.] If the market tanks in the next few days, I will send more.”R&W: “I received the payment. I appreciate the offer if bitcoins lowers in value. We know where he is. He’ll be grabbed tonight. I’ll update you. …Your problem has been taken care of. …They questioned him and he spilled everything he knew. …Rest easy though, because he won’t be blackmailing anyone again. Ever.”DPR: “Excellent work. Please send any info you can get on this third party along with the picture. …I have no need for any of his possessions, so you can do what you want with that stuff.”Told ya.That was part of the chain of events that unfolded in the final day of testimony of the Silk Road trial where federal prosecutor Timothy Howard read a pairing of private messages allegedly sent from Dread Pirate Roberts (Ulbricht) to a person associated with Hell’s Angels (username Redandwhite), which has created suspicion about Ulbricht hiring a hitman to kill someone who was blackmailing him. He allegedly hired them to kill a total of five people, but no formal murder-for-hire charges have been filed in New York, where the Silk Road trial took place. He faces similar charges in Baltimore, though no record of murders linked to the case have been found to date.But the gruesome details behind these messages that came from the Silk Road’s market server and user forum, according to Wired.com, leave room for the question: Just how far was the Dread Pirate Roberts willing to go to protect his identity?It sounds like maybe pretty far.Ulbricht was arrested in October 2013 for seven federal charges related to the Silk Road site used for narcotics-trafficking, illegal goods, computer-hacking tools and money-laundering to an audience in the thousands that turned his “libertarian free-market experiment” into billion dollar drug ring. It also made him filthy rich in bitcoins. The amount of bitcoins seized from Ulbricht was valued somewhere between $18 million and $20 million.The three-week trial chronicled the case following when the Silk Road site was shut down by the Feds. During the trial, Ulbricht’s lawyer claimed that Mark Karpeles, the bitcoin tycoon, was the true Dread Pirate Roberts. Karpeles is the former CEO of Mr. Gox, the busted Bitcoin exchange based in Tokyo. Karpeles shrugged off the accusations and told multiple media outlets that he was not the man the Feds were looking for. Ulbricht’s lawyer admitted that his client founded the Silk Road as a free-market site to sell almost anything that could be untraceable. The defense claimed it was an economic experiment that grew too large and Ulbricht passed off the site to others. They then claimed he was lured back by the operators of the site, baited into the library and put into the hands of the federal government as a scapegoat. But the jury didn’t buy the story.The drama behind the case doesn’t stop there, as Ulbricht allegedly didn’t back down after the first supposed hit was ordered. One hit led to four others, as the transcript read by the prosecutors suggests. And all for $500,000, according to the narrative provided by Wired.com.DPR: “I am confident enough that it is him to move forward. Can we round up all four of them, separate them, and get them to out each other and give up their stolen money?”R&W: “I would send four hitters instead of two to make sure there was no [expletive].”DPR: “OK, let’s just hit Andrew and leave it at that. Try to recover the funds, but if not, then not.”R&W: “If you want to hit Andrew only, I can have it done for $150k just like last time. …I was pretty certain you would want them all taken care, so I had an associate send me a couple of his out-of-town hitters to accompany our local hitters. …If you would like just Andrew done send 150k USD to the same address you sent the other funds to. If you would like all four of them done, and product/money recovered from there send $500k.”DPR: “$500k in [bitcoin] (3,000 @ $166/[bitcoin]) has been sent.”R&W: “That problem was dealt with. I’ll try to catch you online to give you details. Just wanted to let you know right away so you have one less thing to worry about.”DPR: “Thanks, see you on chat.”That testimony was provided Monday in the closing hours of the trial that painted a picture of a man whom prosecutors claimed was living a double life as the operator of the online drug marketplace. He even reveled everything in his suspected private journal on his computer that was seized by the Feds, according to The Wall Street Journal. What prosecutors told the jury, according to WSJ, was that Ulbricht faced many emotions as a result of the rapid success of his tiny libertarian project that grew into a $1.2 billion enterprise. For Ulbricht, it became about power and the anonymity to act outside the law.“Silk Road is going to become a phenomenon and at least one person will tell me about it, unknowing that I was its creator,” he wrote in one entry. What started under the name “Underground Brokers,” soon turned into the Silk Road.And what a journey it became.“I began working on a project that had been in my mind for over a year,” Ulbricht wrote. “The idea was to create a website where people could buy anything anonymously, with no trail whatsoever that could lead back to them.”His double life continued as he told his friends he was “working on a bitcoin exchange,” according to prosecutors. But eventually he broke down, as his journal entry included: “It felt wrong to lie completely so I tried to tell the truth without revealing the bad part, but now I am in a jam,” according to an entry from December 2011.“Everyone knows too much,” the post read.From the posts prosecutors presented, Ulbricht knew the weight of what he had created and the legal issues surrounding the creation of his black market bitcoin project. But he didn’t believe he could be caught, as most criminals on the Deep Web never are.One chat revealed by prosecutors pinpointed this mindset.“What evidence could [prosecutors] pin on you?” the post read. “The only way for them to prove anything would be for them to watch you log in and do your work.”And that’s exactly what the federal agents did when the lured him into a San Francisco public library where he logged on in October 2013 as the Dread Pirate Roberts onto the Silk Road marketplace. That was enough to nab him after two years of following the Deep Web mastermind. That fatal mistake could cost this cybercriminal life in prison.And what does this case mean for bitcoins?Two things.It certainly affirms that bitcoin’s biggest use case was paying for things that you wouldn’t want your mama to know about. And, as a result, they haven’t yet broken on to the list of the federal government’s favorite things.Bitcoin Tracker | Week 60Convicted!That was the big news of the week – as Dread Pirate Roberts, aka the mastermind of Silk Road, finds himself moving into prison, possibly for the rest of his life.Banking of the anonymity of the digital currency, which turned out not to be true, Ulbricht didn’t help bitcoin’s namesake in the world of currency options, particularly in the eye of the Feds. But that’s not the only headline bitcoin made its way into this week.In other news, Juniper Research reports that the value of bitcoin transactions will reach $30B this year, down from $70B last year. Even $70B represented a pindot of a pindot of a pindot of transactions, and these new estimates reduce that tiny pindot by more than half. It’s certainly not at all surprising that bitcoin, this week, is trading again, at $215.44 according to the PYMNTS.com Bitcoin Price index.As always, if you have any news you’d like to share, please send it our way at contactus@pymnts.com.On the Plus Side …Investments might not be quite as high as before, but the dollars are still coming in for some crypto currency startups.

Ross Ulbricht and his team of attorneys found that out the hard way when he was found guilty of running the Silk Road website and for long after the defense team claimed he stopped running his little “experiment.”', 'Greece has never been accused of being an economic savant over the last generation. Using the Drachma for the 3rd time from 1951 to 2001, it’s value declined to the point where Greece joined the E.U.’s new multi-national Euro system in 2002. Greece followed up with three distinct recessions in each year from 2007 through 2009. This required a massive bail-out in 2010, and “austerity measures” ever since for the citizens to live up to, while the bankers who caused the issues continue to mismanage the economy unabated, asking for more loans as we speak.These consistent economic issues have lead to the new regime change in Greece, lead by new motorcycle-riding leader Yanis Varoufakis. He vows to bring change to the people of Greece. Doesn’t that sound familiar?Dating back to 2013, Varoufakis has made many statements about what he believes Bitcoin can and cannot do economically. He has not been impressed by Bitcoin as a way forward for a sovereign nation’s economy.“There can be no de-politicized currency capable of ‘powering’ an advanced, industrial society,” said Varoufakis. “What is, however, genuinely novel and unique about Bitcoin is that no ‘one’ institution or company is safeguarding the so-called Ledger. The record of transactions that ensures that, when you have spent one unit of currency, there is one less unit of currency in your (digital) wallet.”Also read: Greece May Soon Exit The Eurozone – A Role for Bitcoin?Varoufakis’ views as the new Greek leader are important, even if Greece is tied to the Euro like a ball-and-chain. The E.U. is doing so well economically that they are starting to implement the “Quantitative Easing” policies that the U.S. has hidden behind for the bulk of this economic malaise. Also, negative interest rates for banks are beginning to take hold, another sign of the dire straights rampant in the region. Greece is always looking for help these days, and it may be unwise to look this gift horse in the mouth, but accept more debt from the E.U. instead.“In a sense, the designer of the Bitcoin algorithm (the delectable Mr ‘Nakamoto’, who has, by the way, dropped off the radar some time ago) seems to have designed the new currency on the basis of faith in the crudest version of the ‘monetarist’ Quantity Theory of Money (the idea that the value of money depended solely on the quantity of money supplied to the public) and, thus, aimed at creating the digital equivalent to… gold.” , according to Varoufakis in 2013.So you can see he is not overly enamored with the idea of Bitcoin going mainstream on a national level. Honestly, I agree with him, at least as far as Bitcoin’s development to this point. It is not ready to run national economies, nor was it designed for that role. What is important is that this does not color his view of Bitcoin in general, and damage future regulations and freedoms it affords the public. At some point in the future, Greece will have to choose if they are friends or foes with Bitcoin. Bitcoin has much more potential for growth economically than billion-dollar debts and negative interest rates.Considering the fact that Greece no longer has a sovereign national currency, only the Eurozone’s Euro, that should make Bitcoin less threatening domestically. They don’t have a local currency to defend, and they can use the influx of business and investment new Bitcoin industries can provide going forward. Economic growth and high-end jobs are legion in the growing Bitcoin space, and those countries that make nice with the digital currency through regulation can win big, long-term if they play their cards right.Varoufakis may not be a big fan personally, but maybe the people he governs can help him see the light. History tells us the Greek government is no savant when it comes to building the economy from the inside-out, and could use all the advice they can get. The Euro is starting to look more like the Drachma more and more every day.Would you count Greece as against Bitcoin based on Varoufakis’ recent views on Bitcoin?

They were thought to be the cutest couple by all of their friends, and their families were sure an engagement was imminent, but then it turned out that Stellar was cheating on Ripple with a bitcoin mining operation all this time. Ripple discovered the sensual love letter hidden in a closet and decided to confront Stellar a week before their anniversary. Now, both companies aren’t speaking to each other. Ripple is angry at being cheated on, and Stellar says that Ripple doesn’t give it enough space……Okay, that’s not exactly how it went down, but the anger and bad blood between the two companies is undeniably real.According to the publication, Jeb McCaleb, founder of both Ripple Labs and Stellar, as well as Mt. Gox (the company that will forever go down in history as the world’s largest bitcoin accident), had a long and personal relationship with Joyce Kim, the executive director of Stellar. Their activities together jeopardized McCaleb’s relationships with other senior executives and board members at Ripple Labs, which ultimately led to McCaleb’s exit from Ripple and his creation of Stellar.According to the article’s description by author Michael Craig, the story sounds a lot like the digital currency edition of “The Godfather”. I guess Ripple can play Michael Corleone and Stellar can be Kay Adams:“The interpersonal story of Stellar and Ripple Labs is emblematic of the turmoil roiling the entire industry… It has everything: sex, huge money, fraud, genius, betrayal, international intrigue and government raids.”The entire article can be read here.Images from Ripple Labs and Stellar']","[""In perhaps one of the more surprising interview statements from the banking industry, ex-CEO of UBS and Credit Suisse Oswald Gruebel has openly voiced his support for Bitcoin and distrust of fiat currency.Speaking to Cash.ch, Gruebel criticized the inability of banks to prevent economic crises, while championing gold and Bitcoin as credible long-term investment opportunities.Gruebel said:“The only investment that demonstrably keeps its value over a long period is gold, and in future perhaps also bitcoins.”The context surrounding Gruebel’s admission highlights how unexpected his words were. Despite having a fairly open policy towards digital currency industry, Switzerland, the banking capital of Europe, has seen some particularly vehement – and high profile – opposition.Only two months ago, Citibank released a report as part of its retaliation against the Save Our Swiss Gold initiative, describing Bitcoin as being “without intrinsic value,” “costly to produce and store” and even “fiat currency.” The Swiss National Bank (SNB) also shied away from gold itself ahead of the initiative-backed referendum on repatriation of Switzerland’s gold reserves.A counterargument from one of banking’s former major players highlights misalignment within the industry.“Take the total assets of the SNB. In the shortest of periods they went from being worth 50 billion francs to 550 billion. I'm amazed that people were able just to accept that.”Gruebel stated that bank weakness would continue to have an increasing detrimental effect on the global economy.“Capital requirements mean that in future, banks will no longer be in a position to take advantage of their position as market makers,” he explained. “That means that they'll no longer be buying when rates sink, and no longer be selling when they rise. It simply costs too much in terms of capital... Therefore markets can tumble a lot faster than in the past...”Regulators also tellingly came in for criticism.“When I went to Credit Suisse in 2007, regulators told me, ‘Your risk management at CS is a lot worse than at UBS,’” he added. “A year later this was rebutted. There you can see how regulators can fool you.”Gruebel’s statements on Bitcoin were immediately lauded by many in the digital currency community, but as yet no supporting evidence has been had to indicate his true openness towards Bitcoin’s propagation domestically or internationally. One thing for certain, however, is Gruebel’s aversion to money-printing, which comes as little surprise from one of banking’s wealthier veterans. He concluded:“Central banks can print money limitlessly and these days they are telling us that openly. It's therefore no longer recoverable.”Did you enjoy this article?

Silk Road supporters claim that the Silk Road site made it possible for customers to procure so-called “victimless crimes.” But as everyone knows about the drug trade, it’s a violent market. And, as the Silk Road trial transcripts illustrate, when that trade turns onto the Deep Web it can get even darker. And then add bitcoins — the supposed untraceable currency — and you have the perfect environment for dialogue that you might only ever find on TV.Check out what was supposed to be a secret conversation between Dread Pirate Roberts and the alleged hitman connection.DPR: “Not long ago, I had a clean hit done for $80k. …I’ve only ever commissioned the one other hit, so I’m still learning this market.”DPR: “The exchange rate is above $90 right now, so at $90/[bitcoin], $150k is about 1670 [bitcoin.] If the market tanks in the next few days, I will send more.”R&W: “I received the payment. I appreciate the offer if bitcoins lowers in value. We know where he is. He’ll be grabbed tonight. I’ll update you. …Your problem has been taken care of. …They questioned him and he spilled everything he knew. …Rest easy though, because he won’t be blackmailing anyone again. Ever.”DPR: “Excellent work. Please send any info you can get on this third party along with the picture. …I have no need for any of his possessions, so you can do what you want with that stuff.”Told ya.That was part of the chain of events that unfolded in the final day of testimony of the Silk Road trial where federal prosecutor Timothy Howard read a pairing of private messages allegedly sent from Dread Pirate Roberts (Ulbricht) to a person associated with Hell’s Angels (username Redandwhite), which has created suspicion about Ulbricht hiring a hitman to kill someone who was blackmailing him. He allegedly hired them to kill a total of five people, but no formal murder-for-hire charges have been filed in New York, where the Silk Road trial took place. He faces similar charges in Baltimore, though no record of murders linked to the case have been found to date.But the gruesome details behind these messages that came from the Silk Road’s market server and user forum, according to Wired.com, leave room for the question: Just how far was the Dread Pirate Roberts willing to go to protect his identity?It sounds like maybe pretty far.Ulbricht was arrested in October 2013 for seven federal charges related to the Silk Road site used for narcotics-trafficking, illegal goods, computer-hacking tools and money-laundering to an audience in the thousands that turned his “libertarian free-market experiment” into billion dollar drug ring. It also made him filthy rich in bitcoins. The amount of bitcoins seized from Ulbricht was valued somewhere between $18 million and $20 million.The three-week trial chronicled the case following when the Silk Road site was shut down by the Feds. During the trial, Ulbricht’s lawyer claimed that Mark Karpeles, the bitcoin tycoon, was the true Dread Pirate Roberts. Karpeles is the former CEO of Mr. Gox, the busted Bitcoin exchange based in Tokyo. Karpeles shrugged off the accusations and told multiple media outlets that he was not the man the Feds were looking for. Ulbricht’s lawyer admitted that his client founded the Silk Road as a free-market site to sell almost anything that could be untraceable. The defense claimed it was an economic experiment that grew too large and Ulbricht passed off the site to others. They then claimed he was lured back by the operators of the site, baited into the library and put into the hands of the federal government as a scapegoat. But the jury didn’t buy the story.The drama behind the case doesn’t stop there, as Ulbricht allegedly didn’t back down after the first supposed hit was ordered.

They were thought to be the cutest couple by all of their friends, and their families were sure an engagement was imminent, but then it turned out that Stellar was cheating on Ripple with a bitcoin mining operation all this time. Ripple discovered the sensual love letter hidden in a closet and decided to confront Stellar a week before their anniversary. Now, both companies aren’t speaking to each other. Ripple is angry at being cheated on, and Stellar says that Ripple doesn’t give it enough space……Okay, that’s not exactly how it went down, but the anger and bad blood between the two companies is undeniably real.According to the publication, Jeb McCaleb, founder of both Ripple Labs and Stellar, as well as Mt. Gox (the company that will forever go down in history as the world’s largest bitcoin accident), had a long and personal relationship with Joyce Kim, the executive director of Stellar. Their activities together jeopardized McCaleb’s relationships with other senior executives and board members at Ripple Labs, which ultimately led to McCaleb’s exit from Ripple and his creation of Stellar.According to the article’s description by author Michael Craig, the story sounds a lot like the digital currency edition of “The Godfather”. I guess Ripple can play Michael Corleone and Stellar can be Kay Adams:“The interpersonal story of Stellar and Ripple Labs is emblematic of the turmoil roiling the entire industry… It has everything: sex, huge money, fraud, genius, betrayal, international intrigue and government raids.”The entire article can be read here.Images from Ripple Labs and Stellar']"

Paying a scrip dividend would involve offering investors dividends in shares instead of cash. Jon Peace, analyst at Nomura, said Credit Suisse might give investors a choice between the two, as in 2011. “It might be the best compromise between wanting to improve the capital ratios but also wanting to signal some strength in the balance sheet,” he said. “It’s certainly not transformational to their capital ratio but it would be helpful.” UBS, which reveals full-year results on Tuesday, has already announced a special dividend of 25 cents a share for 2014 after the bank revamped its corporate structure and is expected to at least match 2013’s ordinary dividend of 25 cents.

This indicates that bag revenue is remaining steady despite the drop in oil prices.The bar graph on the right looks at the amount of baggage revenue collected by individual airlines.You'd be hard-pressed to find a bigger benefactor of low oil prices than airliners. Between October 13, when the market bottomed, and December 31, 2014, Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) gained 59% and American Airlines (Nasdaq: AAL) jumped 82%.Last year, Delta and American Airlines each used about 4 billion gallons of jet fuel. With oil prices now half of what they were for the majority of 2014, airlines have the potential to cut their expenses significantly. Analysts project that, if oil prices remain low this year, airlines will be able to cut their operating expenses by about 16%.Low oil prices should ensure airlines spend less...But, as any frequent flier knows, that isn't stopping them from charging more.As oil prices continue to be volatile, look for discount airliners such as Spirit Airlines (Nasdaq: SAVE) to start picking up more revenue from irritated and economically savvy passengers.Editor's Note: For the last few months, Resource Strategist Sean Brodrick has been working on a private briefing to bring Oxford Club Members a unique and highly profitable alternative investment.

The We-Vibe was developed in the basement of their Ottawa home. (Standard Innovation)He was working on a vibrator couples can use together. The concept was born one day when he and wife Melody, also a former Nortel employee, were brainstorming possible inventions.They joked about creating a sex toy and the idea somehow stuck. Melody says they then asked themselves the question, ""Is there anything that [a couple] can share?""Believing they found an untapped market, the Murisons did their research. That included visiting adult novelty stores.""I remember the first sex toy store I dragged Melody into. We had never been to one before we started this endeavour, so there was definitely a learning curve,"" explained Bruce.\'I remember the first sex toy store I dragged Melody into. We had never been to one before\' - Bruce Murison, We-Vibe inventorHe also handed out surveys in downtown Ottawa to find out what women — besides Melody — wanted.""I did whatever it took,"" says Bruce. That included ""getting nicely dressed government ladies\' opinions.""Bruce adds that ""Melody at the time was afraid that one of the neighbours would see me and recognize me.""What will the neighbours think?Not knowing how their neighbours would react, the Murisons kept quiet about what Bruce was doing in the basement. Only their two daughters knew; their six-year-old son was too young to understand.It took years for Bruce to get it right: scrapping numerous prototypes, miniaturizing motors, fine-tuning the electronics and ""finding a shape that would conform to people and not interfere with normal lovemaking.""His final product: a small, C-shaped vibrator that couples can enjoy simultaneously. The Murisons named it the We-Vibe.\'We either have to sell 10,000 We-Vibes between now and March or we\'re going to go bankrupt.\' - Bruce Murison, We-Vibe inventorWith no money coming in, the couple had mortgaged their home and took out three lines of credit. Bruce said when they were finally ready to take the device to market, ""there was one grandiose moment where we said, \'OK, after this point, we either have to sell 10,000 We-Vibes between now and March or we\'re going to go bankrupt.\'""The couple actually doubled their goal, selling 20,000 units in just three months in 2008.It\'s a hitEndorsements by celebrity sex experts — from Canada’s Sue Johanson to Dr. Laura Berman on The Dr. Oz Show — were huge boosts for business. So was a mention on Oprah.com in a segment titled Beginner\'s Guide to Erotica.The toy was even added to Oscars gift bags in 2009.The Murisons\' neighbours eventually discovered their secret, but the couple had no reason to worry. Some asked for free samples and one sent flowers. ""There was definitely a lot of hometown pride,"" Melody says.The couple began their business at home with just one paid employee. Now their company, Standard Innovation, has 43 full-time staff. Millions of We-Vibes have sold across the globe and there\'s now more than eight variations of the product.The gadget has also garnered more than 20 international awards. The most recent: best couples sex toy for the We-Vibe 4 Plus at the Sexual Health Expo in Los Angeles last month.The 4 Plus – the latest We-Vibe model – can be controlled using a phone app that allows one partner to operate the toy from miles away.Customer satisfactionBruce attributes the toy\'s success to the fact that it\'s a small, non-intimidating device that ""doesn\'t alienate or replace the man. It makes sex better for both. So I don\'t think men are threatened the way they are by a phallic device.""Tina McKeown, who first tried the We-Vibe with a boyfriend, agrees.""It was his first toy ever. Men are a little shy when it comes to that,"" she says, adding her boyfriend was enthusiastic about the We-Vibe 3 that includes a remote control.""You know men love remotes,"" she says. ""It definitely enhances the sexual experience.""Although they can\'t divulge details yet, the Murisons\' company is working on more We-Vibe variations. ""It\'s sort of a never-ending process of improvement,"" Bruce says.The couple has no shame, just pride in what they\'ve been able to achieve.""A lot of women want to shake his hand [to] thank him,"" Melody says.']","['NEW YORK (InsideBitcoins) — After trading mostly in a tight range near $220 for weeks — including most of last week — bitcoin broke through the resistance Friday gaining nearly $20, “closing” at $236.70, according to the Winkdex composite.

Between October 13, when the market bottomed, and December 31, 2014, Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) gained 59% and American Airlines (Nasdaq: AAL) jumped 82%.Last year, Delta and American Airlines each used about 4 billion gallons of jet fuel. With oil prices now half of what they were for the majority of 2014, airlines have the potential to cut their expenses significantly. Analysts project that, if oil prices remain low this year, airlines will be able to cut their operating expenses by about 16%.Low oil prices should ensure airlines spend less...But, as any frequent flier knows, that isn't stopping them from charging more.As oil prices continue to be volatile, look for discount airliners such as Spirit Airlines (Nasdaq: SAVE) to start picking up more revenue from irritated and economically savvy passengers.Editor's Note: For the last few months, Resource Strategist Sean Brodrick has been working on a private briefing to bring Oxford Club Members a unique and highly profitable alternative investment.

The We-Vibe was developed in the basement of their Ottawa home. (Standard Innovation)He was working on a vibrator couples can use together. The concept was born one day when he and wife Melody, also a former Nortel employee, were brainstorming possible inventions.They joked about creating a sex toy and the idea somehow stuck. Melody says they then asked themselves the question, ""Is there anything that [a couple] can share?""Believing they found an untapped market, the Murisons did their research. That included visiting adult novelty stores.""I remember the first sex toy store I dragged Melody into. We had never been to one before we started this endeavour, so there was definitely a learning curve,"" explained Bruce.\'I remember the first sex toy store I dragged Melody into. We had never been to one before\' - Bruce Murison, We-Vibe inventorHe also handed out surveys in downtown Ottawa to find out what women — besides Melody — wanted.""I did whatever it took,"" says Bruce. That included ""getting nicely dressed government ladies\' opinions.""Bruce adds that ""Melody at the time was afraid that one of the neighbours would see me and recognize me.""What will the neighbours think?Not knowing how their neighbours would react, the Murisons kept quiet about what Bruce was doing in the basement. Only their two daughters knew; their six-year-old son was too young to understand.It took years for Bruce to get it right: scrapping numerous prototypes, miniaturizing motors, fine-tuning the electronics and ""finding a shape that would conform to people and not interfere with normal lovemaking.""His final product: a small, C-shaped vibrator that couples can enjoy simultaneously. The Murisons named it the We-Vibe.\'We either have to sell 10,000 We-Vibes between now and March or we\'re going to go bankrupt.\' - Bruce Murison, We-Vibe inventorWith no money coming in, the couple had mortgaged their home and took out three lines of credit. Bruce said when they were finally ready to take the device to market, ""there was one grandiose moment where we said, \'OK, after this point, we either have to sell 10,000 We-Vibes between now and March or we\'re going to go bankrupt.\'""The couple actually doubled their goal, selling 20,000 units in just three months in 2008.It\'s a hitEndorsements by celebrity sex experts — from Canada’s Sue Johanson to Dr. Laura Berman on The Dr. Oz Show — were huge boosts for business. So was a mention on Oprah.com in a segment titled Beginner\'s Guide to Erotica.The toy was even added to Oscars gift bags in 2009.The Murisons\' neighbours eventually discovered their secret, but the couple had no reason to worry. Some asked for free samples and one sent flowers. ""There was definitely a lot of hometown pride,"" Melody says.The couple began their business at home with just one paid employee. Now their company, Standard Innovation, has 43 full-time staff. Millions of We-Vibes have sold across the globe and there\'s now more than eight variations of the product.The gadget has also garnered more than 20 international awards. The most recent: best couples sex toy for the We-Vibe 4 Plus at the Sexual Health Expo in Los Angeles last month.The 4 Plus – the latest We-Vibe model – can be controlled using a phone app that allows one partner to operate the toy from miles away.Customer satisfactionBruce attributes the toy\'s success to the fact that it\'s a small, non-intimidating device that ""doesn\'t alienate or replace the man. It makes sex better for both. So I don\'t think men are threatened the way they are by a phallic device.""Tina McKeown, who first tried the We-Vibe with a boyfriend, agrees.""It was his first toy ever. Men are a little shy when it comes to that,"" she says, adding her boyfriend was enthusiastic about the We-Vibe 3 that includes a remote control.""You know men love remotes,"" she says. ""It definitely enhances the sexual experience.""Although they can\'t divulge details yet, the Murisons\' company is working on more We-Vibe variations. ""It\'s sort of a never-ending process of improvement,"" Bruce says.The couple has no shame, just pride in what they\'ve been able to achieve.""A lot of women want to shake his hand [to] thank him,"" Melody says.']"

You become part of a rolling maul of politicians, journalists and economists ripping and gouging at each other, both in private and on Twitter. The only advantage of being there is that it forces you to think laterally about money. Soon – if the Greek crisis is not resolved – one of the most audacious pieces of lateral thinking ever could get a try-out: a parallel digital currency, issued by the Greek government, modelled on Bitcoin, but with a crucial difference.The Guardian view on the Greek debt deal: victory or defeat? | Editorial Read moreIn orthodox economics, money barely figures. It’s just there, acting as a lubricant to supply and demand. The assumption is: markets create money, and the state’s role is to make sure it’s not fake or diluted.Bitcoin is an audacious attempt to create money beyond the control of any state. It is a digital currency, in the form of a limited number of tokens. It is championed by people who would, if they could, return to a gold standard – where states are obliged to limit the amount of money in the economy. What these money fundamentalists worry about is states creating so much money that booms and busts become inevitable and inflation erodes wealth. In this sense, Bitcoin’s aim is to function as “digital gold”.If things go badly for Greece, finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has said he would consider creating a parallel digital currency, using Bitcoin’s digital security and transparency, but doing the exact opposite of what the money fundamentalists intend.Let’s recap the problem. The Greek debt is unpayable; the austerity required to pay it down is socially unbearable. So whether it’s this week or in six months’ time, there will come a point when Athens cannot meet conditions acceptable to the European Central Bank. Then, the normal sequence would be: bank closures, capital controls, an angry standoff and ultimately a Greek default.If you insert a parallel currency into this sequence, you can delay the moment of default and gain a lot of leeway.Varoufakis outlined, in a detailed blog post 12 months ago, how a Bitcoin-like virtual currency could be used to get around the ECB’s refusal to boost demand through quantitative easing. Just like Bitcoin, it would be exchangeable one for one with euros. But it would be issued by the state – and if you were prepared to hold it for two years, you would earn a profit paid for by taxes. For this reason, Varoufakis called it “future-tax coin”.If the Greek government issued a parallel digital currency, and forced banks and businesses to use it, this would boost the money supply in defiance of the policy of the European Central Bank, said Varoufakis. In addition, he predicted, the currency would provide “a source of liquidity for the governments that is outside the bond markets, which does not involve the banks and which lies outside any of the restrictions imposed by Brussels or the various troikas”.It would create an extra call on the nation’s tax revenues, so would have to be capped. If you issued future-tax coins worth 10% of GDP, in two years’ time, you would lose a sizeable chunk of your tax bill, warned Varoufakis.So another way of thinking about a parallel second currency is: it’s a way of borrowing from tax receipts tomorrow to fund a monetary stimulus today. Which, if you reduce it even further, is like getting a fiscal stimulus for free. If used in crisis mode, it would also allow Greece to survive, for a time, its banks being sunk by the withdrawal of ECB emergency aid.If a parallel currency ever happens (I am writing this on Friday: anything could happen by Monday), it will dramatise one of the key arguments of anti-establishment economists like Varoufakis: that states – not markets – create money.Money only has value, say these economists, because states decree it. Furthermore, the state is not just standing above the market, regulating the currency: the act of taxing and spending is what creates money, not the act of buying and selling in a marketplace. It’s called “modern monetary theory”, but it’s no mere theory.If it is right, the obvious practical conclusion is that a state with its own currency is always solvent. It can always create more money and pay people in that money. Therefore, it can always run a deficit – always use state spending to suppress unemployment. The only condition is that people must believe the state will exist in future.And this is where it gets dicey for both the eurozone and Greece. If the Germans kick Greece out of the euro, that raises a big question mark over whether the euro quasi-state will permanently stand behind the currency as designed. The euro might come under speculative attack, as investors seek to pick off the next Greece, and place bets on the value of any new currencies that might emerge.But the risks are even higher for Greece, should it start issuing a parallel, digital euro. Because Varoufakis’s digital currency is only redeemable against future tax revenues, you would have to believe the Greek state could not collapse.Given these doubts, another of Syriza’s big-hitter economists turned politicians, Costas Lapavitsas of Soas, points out, the use of a digital currency would have to be just a transition phase to euro exit and a new Greek currency.Bizarre and mind-boggling as the parallel currency idea is, my experience in the eurocrisis makes me think it’s likely to happen at some point. So, as you observe me and my fellow eurocrisis tribespeople eking out our lives in dank hotels and lobbies, do not pity us. All the shouting and the whispering only looks like mental torture. It is, in fact, a grand philosophical debate about the nature of money.Paul Mason is economics editor at Channel 4 News.Follow him @paulmasonnews', ""Stripe has finally opened up Bitcoin payments for all of its users, after more than a year of beta testing. The new service launched today and merchants can add Bitcoin as an option for their customers with one small line of code.Stripe launched a beta program for bitcoin back in May 2014. During that time, merchants accepted bitcoin from more than 60 countries, proving its global capabilities. Stripe added support for Apple Pay and Alipay last year, but neither of those centralized services hold the same global potential as Bitcoin.Stripe will be taking a 0.5 % fee for every bitcoin transaction, so there are cheaper bitcoin-centric alternatives. It is, however, much cheaper than Stripe's other options. Fiat options through Stripe run a 2.9% fee, plus 30 cents, for every successful transaction. This spread should be enough to demonstrate the power of Bitcoin to Stripe merchants.While bitcoin buyers can come from anywhere in the world, merchants will be required to hold a U.S. bank account in order to accept bitcoin through Stripe.Stripe is one of the largest mobile payment processors in the world, and is utilized by Kickstarter, Shopify, Lyft, Pebble, and many more.While the Stripe bitcoin beta program was never the most difficult thing to get into, Stripe jumping completely into the industry did coincide with a modest rise in bitcoin price that may have also been buoyed by Morgan Spurlock's CNN special that aired the day before.We reached out to some other experts in the industry, and Nathan Wosnack of Blockchain Factory gave us this quote.“With Stripe's user base, they have an opportunity to profit and even maintain a strong position, perhaps even as leaders. They are deeply ingrained in the traditional payment processing world, and innovated. [. . .] And what great timing, right after Morgan Spurlock had a phenomenal CNN episode which arguably was the best explanation of bitcoin and its potential to the layman.”Predictably, the news was welcomed from the vast majority of the bitcoin industry. Even Fred Wilson, who is invested in Coinbase and is now a potential competitor to Stripe in the Bitcoin payment processors market. As noticed by bizjournals, he had some positive things to say on his blog.“It’s things like this, making it drop dead simple for merchants to accept bitcoin, that will help drive adoption of Bitcoin payments in the coming years.”Coinbase seems dedicated to improving the legitimacy of Bitcoin. That explains much of its behavior, which has annoyed a certain segment of the bitcoin using public. A company like Stripe is yet another check in the column for the legitimacy of bitcoin. If Shopify merchants are accepting bitcoin at farmer’s markets and if Lyft drivers are giving discounts for bitcoin customers, it stops being the weird digital currency used by drug dealers to the public and becomes the currency used by their neighbors.The number of big name merchants that jumped into the Bitcoin space last year is well documented. But as was the case with Paypal and Braintree's movement into the space, the positive effects won't be felt right away, or at all. It is up to the individual merchants to begin accepting the digital currency, and up to the bitcoin faithful to convince them to do so.Did you enjoy this article?

Through this deal we can significantly accelerate our mobile commerce efforts. LoopPay’s outstanding leaders and team have deep-rooted relationships with banks, card networks and merchants that will complement those Samsung has established over the years.""Most mobile payment systems, including Apple Pay, Google Wallet, and Softcard (formerly Isis), rely on NFC technology. NFC requires retailers to upgrade their in-store payment terminals to newer ones equipped with NFC wireless chips.Launched a year ago, LoopPay already has 50 million active accounts. Its technology makes use of the existing magnetic stripe reader already available in most stores, removing the need for retailers to make any further investment in new infrastructure.This major differentiator allows LoopPay\'s system to work in approximately 90% of existing point-of-sale (POS) terminals, compared to the 200,000 payment terminals in the US that currently accept NFC.JK Shin, President and Head of IT and Mobile Division at Samsung Electronics, stated:""This acquisition accelerates our vision to drive and lead innovation in the world of mobile commerce. Our goal has always been to build the smartest, most secure, user-friendly mobile wallet experience, and we are delighted to welcome LoopPay to take us closer to this goal.""As part of the acquisition, LoopPay founders Will Graylin and George Wallner will work closely with Samsung\'s Mobile Division.Currently, LoopPay works through a mobile application and a standalone hardware device. However, LoopPay\'s technology may be implemented directly into phones in the future, where Samsung devices could have the potential to replace credit cards the same way that Apple Pay is looking to do.Along with the mobile payment industry, Samsung Electronics had set sight on the blockchain tech, announcing in September 2014, a partnership with IBM to explore possible applications for the blockchain.The partnership will see the technology giants consult on Adept, a new protocol which will be used to resolve the various problems associated with the concept of the Internet of Things.Did you enjoy this article?

You become part of a rolling maul of politicians, journalists and economists ripping and gouging at each other, both in private and on Twitter. The only advantage of being there is that it forces you to think laterally about money. Soon – if the Greek crisis is not resolved – one of the most audacious pieces of lateral thinking ever could get a try-out: a parallel digital currency, issued by the Greek government, modelled on Bitcoin, but with a crucial difference.The Guardian view on the Greek debt deal: victory or defeat? | Editorial Read moreIn orthodox economics, money barely figures. It’s just there, acting as a lubricant to supply and demand. The assumption is: markets create money, and the state’s role is to make sure it’s not fake or diluted.Bitcoin is an audacious attempt to create money beyond the control of any state. It is a digital currency, in the form of a limited number of tokens. It is championed by people who would, if they could, return to a gold standard – where states are obliged to limit the amount of money in the economy. What these money fundamentalists worry about is states creating so much money that booms and busts become inevitable and inflation erodes wealth. In this sense, Bitcoin’s aim is to function as “digital gold”.If things go badly for Greece, finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has said he would consider creating a parallel digital currency, using Bitcoin’s digital security and transparency, but doing the exact opposite of what the money fundamentalists intend.Let’s recap the problem. The Greek debt is unpayable; the austerity required to pay it down is socially unbearable. So whether it’s this week or in six months’ time, there will come a point when Athens cannot meet conditions acceptable to the European Central Bank. Then, the normal sequence would be: bank closures, capital controls, an angry standoff and ultimately a Greek default.If you insert a parallel currency into this sequence, you can delay the moment of default and gain a lot of leeway.Varoufakis outlined, in a detailed blog post 12 months ago, how a Bitcoin-like virtual currency could be used to get around the ECB’s refusal to boost demand through quantitative easing.

03/28/2015,"['Most people following developments in Bitcoin are familiar with the often repeated mantra proclaiming the blockchain an innovative technological breakthrough, but Bitcoin an unnecessary and superfluous addition.Blockchain vs. BitcoinRecent reports, for example, suggest IBM is exploring the use of Bitcoin-less blockchain technology. Separating Bitcoin from the blockchain, however, misses the fundamental, interdependent relationship between digital currency and its underlying blockchain technology.In other words, you can’t have one without the other.To be clear, when some speak of loving blockchain technology, they are referring to its use in areas beyond transferring monetary value, so called “Bitcoin 2.0” functions. For purposes of this article, I am not referring to these Bitcoin 2.0 possibilities. Rather, this article addresses whether blockchain technology can exist as a medium to exchanging financial value without bitcoin, or any native currency component.Value TransferThe blockchain is a peer-to-peer public ledger maintained by a distributed network of computers. There is no central authority, and no need a trusted third party to process and verify transactions. Eliminating the need for third party intermediaries while maintaining a system that is completely secure, trusted, and verifiable is why the blockchain shines as a technologically innovative medium of exchange.To accomplish this, the blockchain must record transactions in a manner that allows anyone to objectively determine how much value has transferred just by observation. Let’s say Sarah in the United States wants to send money—US$100 worth—to Adam in the Czech Republic. Doing this through traditional means—say a bank wire—requires intermediary banks to process and settle the transaction by making sure Sarah is debited, Adam is credited, and so forth.To do this via blockchain technology without intermediaries, the transfer of value must be recorded in a way so that Sarah, Adam, and anyone else can look at the ledger and clearly determine that value has passed from Sarah to Adam. This occurs by recording the transfer of a digital coin—or token—from Sarah’s wallet to Adam’s wallet, demonstrating the transfer of value.To be a truly decentralized exchange without intermediaries, this token cannot simply be a marker representing some other value, this token must speak for itself—it must have price. With the exchange of bitcoin, we know Sarah transferred value to Adam because she transferred something valuable to Adam. We know bitcoin is valuable because we can go to one of many exchanges around the world to buy and sell it at the prevailing market price.In Sarah’s case, the transferred token should have a price equal to US$100 dollars, 2,500 Czech crowns, or whatever unit one wants to use to measure its price at the time of the transaction. Thus, the entry on the blockchain ledger records the circulation of a token with price to signify the exchange of value—which looks a lot like currency.Any entity, whether it’s a solo programmer or IBM, is free to create its own blockchain with its own digital token, which would essentially be one of many “alt-coins” in existence. While little is known about IBM’s blockchain plans, if they—or any other entity—wants to utilize blockchain technology as a decentralized medium of exchange, it must involve the transfer of a valuable digital token—and something does not become valuable just by saying so. This is determined by the market.If IBM’s plan involves some form of a centralized blockchain, then the participants could define the value of its token within the closed system. This system would not be open and trustless. Participation in this blockchain would be limited, the participants would have to agree upon the value of the token, and a central authority would have to hold the parties to this value. Outside these participants, a centralized blockchain would be useless and its tokens would be of limited value.ConclusionBitcoin’s price is supported in large part by speculators who are attracted by its potential to increase in value due to its scarcity, secure network, and first-mover advantage. Any would-be decentralized blockchain would have to convince the market its digital token is valuable, which is no small feat.Alternative blockchains would be in competition with Bitcoin’s blockchain, which already has a vast pool of miners and participants working to secure the network to earn bitcoin; its structure would be in competition with Bitcoin’s decentralized model open to all participants; and its tokens would be in competition with bitcoin, which, while volatile, has thus far stood the test of time and has gained price worldwide.By Waseem KarimDid you enjoy this article?

Which coins will succeed and which coins will fade away into cyber obscurity? While it would be impossible to predict the destiny of the more than 500 cryptocurrencies currently on the market, the top three, bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin are traveling along a path where their roles are coming into focus.Bitcoin: digital goldMost cryptocurrency experts will tell you that Bitcoin is destined to be the dominant digital currency used in internet commerce for the foreseeable future; but I see a different future for Bitcoin. The vast majority of people currently purchasing it are holding it as a speculative investment instead of spending it like a currency. According to a 2014 Forbes article by Samantha Sharf, “over 90% of bitcoins are hoarded.”When Satoshi Nakamoto created the currency, he designed it to mimic the scarcity of gold. Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist and since the block reward will dwindle to just 0.78 BTC by 2032, it will inevitably lead to even more hoarding.Because bitcoin has a fixed supply it is deflationary by design, therefore the longer coins are held the greater the buying power they should have. How many times have we all heard stories of people who mined or purchased a large number of bitcoins when they were almost worthless that now own hard drives that are literally worth many times their weight in gold?Because of this most people primarily view bitcoin as an investment vehicle to drive them down the road to wealth and prosperity rather than an instrument for facilitating retail transactions.Bitcoin is becoming exactly what it was created to be - the digital version of gold. It is mined like gold, it is scarce like gold, and it can’t be counterfeited like gold only easier to store and transfer.LitecoinSo does this mean litecoin will become the dominant currency for e-commerce with conformation times that are four times faster than Bitcoin? Like bitcoin, litecoin is also a deflationary currency and even though it has a larger supply limit of 84 million compared to Bitcoin‘s 21 million, it also mimics gold and is still mainly held as an investment rather than spent like a currency.With a per coin value that is roughly 1/15 the price of bitcoin, litecoin is a poor man’s bitcoin and the equivalent of digital silver to bitcoin’s digital gold. Just as silver attracts many investors so does litecoin, but investors are not consumers and if a currency is going to be a currency it needs to be spent by consumers.DogecoinThis is where I believe Dogecoin comes in. At the moment most people who purchase significant amounts of dogecoin are also buying it as an investment, but after cryptocurrencies achieve mass acceptance and their prices go up, dogecoin holders will spend it freely instead of hoarding it.This is because, unlike bitcoin and litecoin, dogecoin is not deflationary since its supply is uncapped; therefore after its price peaks the declining yearly inflation rate currently 5.256% (4% in 2019, 3.4% in 2025 and 2.5% by 2035 etc.) will keep pace with economic growth and cause the coin’s value to remain stable.A stable price will encourage people to spend dogecoin instead of hoarding it in hopes that the coin will keep going up in value forever. Having an uncapped supply also keeps transaction fees low since miners will always be rewarded and have an incentive to process transactions and keep the network secure.These features are all conducive for dogecoin to emerge as the frontrunner in facilitating retail transactions. In the future, I believe that both bitcoin and litecoin will continue to be held mainly as a digital gold and digital silver investment while dogecoin will become the new digital dollar.By Dwain FindlayDid you enjoy this article?

The story is set in India and United States, involves assassination of an US Senator, FBI’s investigation that leads to Cotton Trail (sounds like Silk Road) and then comes the India connection with the domestic operations of an international bank being the target of multiple scams including a couple of murdered employees and so on.

The world’s largest asset manager ended up holding 20.8 per cent of Monadelphous Group, above the 20 per cent threshold that requires an investor to make an offer for the whole company under Australian stock market rules, after a one-day buying spree. A series of BlackRock entities bought 8.6m shares in Monadelphous, pushing the share price up 25 per cent, on March 20, the day the Perth-based company was demoted from the S&P/ASX 100 index of blue-chip stocks under a quarterly rebalancing. In a filing to the Australian Securities Exchange, BlackRock admitted it had no intention of buying more than 20 per cent of the company. In a statement to FTfm, BlackRock laid the blame with unnamed third-party index providers that compile the benchmarks underlying some of its dividend income funds. It claimed these providers had seriously underweighted Monadelphous for two years, meaning BlackRock had to buy a lot more stock when this error was corrected. “Monadelphous’s stock was reweighted across multiple indices by major index providers on March 20, correcting for previous mis-underweightings, which led to this stock’s exposure more than doubling in some indices. As a result, the firm rebalanced its weightings in line with this correction, resulting in the firm briefly owning more than 20 per cent of the stock,” BlackRock said. “Our internal controls identified the issue, we reported it to the regulator and disclosed it to the market and the company.

Separating Bitcoin from the blockchain, however, misses the fundamental, interdependent relationship between digital currency and its underlying blockchain technology.In other words, you can’t have one without the other.To be clear, when some speak of loving blockchain technology, they are referring to its use in areas beyond transferring monetary value, so called “Bitcoin 2.0” functions. For purposes of this article, I am not referring to these Bitcoin 2.0 possibilities.

05/10/2015,"['(This story corrects the 8th paragraph of the story which ran on May 8, 2015 to show Dapps Venture Fund is based in Austin, Texas, not San Antonio, Texas)By Gertrude Chavez-DreyfussNEW YORK (Reuters) - USAA, a San Antonio, Texas-based financial institution serving current and former members of the military, is studying the underlying technology behind the digital currency bitcoin to help make its operations more efficient, a company executive said.Alex Marquez, managing director of corporate development at USAA, said in an interview this week that the company and its banking, insurance, and investment management subsidiaries hoped the “blockchain” technology could help decentralize its operations such as the back office.He said USAA had a large team researching the potential of the blockchain, an open ledger of a digital currency’s transactions, viewed as bitcoin’s main technological innovation. It lets users make payments anonymously, instantly, and without government regulation.The blockchain ledger is accessible to all users of bitcoin, a virtual currency created through a computer “mining” process that uses millions of calculations. Bitcoin has no ties to a central bank and is viewed as an alternative to paying for goods and services with credit cards.A Bitcoin (virtual currency) paper wallet with QR codes and coins are seen in an illustration picture taken at La Maison du Bitcoin in Paris July 11, 2014. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier“We have serious interest in the blockchain and we think the technology would have an impact on the organization,” said Marquez. “The fact that we have such a large group of people working on this shows how serious we are about the potential of this technology.”USAA, which provides banking, insurance and other products to 10.7 million current or former members of the military, owns and manages assets of about $213 billion.Marquez said USAA had no plans to dabble in the bitcoin as a currency. Its foray into the blockchain reflects a trend among banking institutions trying to integrate bitcoin technology into their systems. BNY Mellon and UBS have announced initiatives to explore the blockchain technology.Most large banks are testing the blockchain internally, said David Johnston, managing director at Dapps Venture Fund in Austin, Texas. “All of the banks are going through that process of trying to understand how this technology is going to evolve.”“I would say that by the end of the year, most will have solidified a blockchain technology strategy, how the bank is going to implement and how it will move the technology forward.”USAA is still in early stages of its research and has yet to identify how it will implement the technology.In January this year, USAA invested in Coinbase, the biggest bitcoin company, which runs a host of services, including an exchange and a wallet, which is how bitcoins are stored by users online.', 'Mysterious Bitcoin startup 21 Inc. may be coming to a toaster near you, with a report over the weekend perhaps disclosing clearly for the first time what the company with $121 million in the bank is planning to do.According to a report from Coinspeak, 21 Inc. is building “new technology that is expected to facilitate worldwide bitcoin adoption and promote bitcoin mining.”That, of course, could mean anything and everything, but then the details get more interesting:Under the company’s new business plan, 21 Inc. will insert ASIC chips for bitcoin mining into such daily devices as routers, gaming consoles, USB battery chargers, toasters, set-top boxes, and chipsets.21 Inc. is said to have partnered with Qualcomm and Intel to work on the development of what’s being described as “split chip” technology for the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Although not made clear the terminology may suggest the embedding of Bitcoin mining hardware on to existing IoT chips.The company is also said to be seeking partnerships CISCO, Facebook, and IBM.Radical distribution planA salesman might say “but wait, there’s more” and there most certainly is from this report: 21 Inc. is said to be planning to attract new customers by offering devices for free.In return for free devices, 21 Inc. will get a revenue share from the Bitcoin mining in each device: 75 percent going to 21 Inc. and the end user receiving the remaining 25 percent.That’s right: a free toaster with a Bitcoin miner that revenue shares.While it is easy to joke about the toaster, it goes further as 21 Inc. wants to put the tech into everything including smart LED light bulbs and even smart doorhandles.Radical might not be the right word, but stranger ideas have worked in the past, although this is right up there with the strangest of them.As we covered when they took their last round of $116 million back in March, the company still officially remains mysterious (there’s still nothing on their website) and we can’t verify at this time whether all these details are correct, although we will attempt to during the week.Despite the somewhat odd nature of the proposal, Investors in 21 Inc. include some of the cream of VC from Silicon Valley, so there might be something to the idea; investors include Peter Thiel, Qualcomm Ventures, Data Collective, Khosla Ventures, Yuan Capital, RRE Ventures and others.', 'Collapse. It seems to be a word that is becoming more and more relevant in our everyday lives. The economic collapse of Greece. The collapse of the Petrodollar. The collapse of our civil liberties and constitutional rights. And the upcoming collapse of the U.S. Dollar. There’s a lot on our plate right now, but why not lay all the cards on the table? What would happen if Bitcoin collapsed? This possibility is much closer than you think, and efforts to avert it are underway, but what if nothing was done? Let’s pretend everyone just acted like everything’s peach fuss with Bitcoin and its current block chain trajectory. All the signs were ignored, and more and more people jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon. Here’s a glimpse into one version of the future.A Bitcoin Collapse is Very PossibleIf all signs were ignored, that the Bitcoin Core capacity was ignored, in the very initial stages of collapse, you wouldn’t notice a thing. Your normal Bitcoin transaction would collect in a “memory pool”, where transactions go before appearing in the block chain. These transactions would be alive in a node’s memory only. The first sign of trouble would be the transaction times. Once the core capacity reaches 80%, about half of the transactions would double in confirmation time to 20 minutes. As capacity approaches 100% full, the transactions would start to create a backlog, and this is where it would get tricky.The Bitcoin core is not designed to handle a backlog of transactions. The backlog creates a memory queue until the Bitcoin node does one of three things. Option one, the node slows down dramatically under the pressure. Option two, the node crashes or collapse when it tries to find enough memory and fails to do so. Or option three, the node is killed by the operating system kernel. The owner of the core needs to manual restart it, and notice that it has collapsed in some form. This takes time. While this is going on, Bitcoin wallets, not knowing the system’s internal strife, keeps sending in new transactions at up to seven per second. Like having three people stand on top of you, with a football team heading your way. Not good.Would rebooting the node clear the memory and solve the problem? Yes and no. It creates brand new problems like double-spending. And the wallets will still keep re-doing the transactions until they get confirmations, so the problem will repeat soon enough, only now double-spending is on the menu, and the backlog will worsen. Now, the block size is at 1 MB, but this scenario did happen at the 250KB block size, two years ago. The solution was to increase the “soft block size limit” of blocks. There were a lot of angry people and wayward transactions, and this was with far fewer people in the Bitcoin network. It’s best not to replicate this after every two years of growth.Also read: We Have a Bitcoin Soft Fork Going On – ETA of Increased Block Size “6 Months to a Year”You could increase the fee you pay per transaction, but this also would create a wormhole in the opposite direction, exacerbating the Bitcoin collapse problem. You pay a little bit more, and the next guy pays a little bit more, and you don’t get a confirmation, so you redo your transaction at a higher price. You are just throwing spaghetti at a wall. People worldwide are generating more and more transactions to get confirmations, and nothing is getting done but a bigger and bigger backlog, destroying more and more nodes under the pressure.Do you think the mainstream media might get tipped off that Bitcoin is having rampant fee escalation, double-spending worldwide, confirmations taking hours if at all, and internal systems crashing throughout the block chain? Like Bitcoin needs more bad publicity? The Bitcoin developers look bad, the currency would look bad, people would start to lose faith in the protocol. People start to sell Bitcoin, head into “cold storage” to sell dormant BTC, and meanwhile the backlog gets worse and worse.Also read: Bitcoin Network Capacity Reaching Critical StateThis is what could happen if nothing is done, according to Mike Hearn, potentially turning Bitcoin into the MySpace of digital currency. And if Bitcoin goes down, it likely takes every altcoin down with it. Bitcoin businesses, trying to take it mainstream, would fold, or downsize, and move onto the next big thing. The “Network Effect”, the venture capital, and most importantly the belief in the protocol all would suffer death blows.This upcoming, and fairly simple problem to solve is a good sign. It’s a sign that Bitcoin is continuing to grow, as expected. This is the kind of problem owners, and users should want to have. How to handle Bitcoin’s future growth. Visa does over 200 transactions per second. PayPal about 125. Bitcoin is stuck at seven, and it’s time to make a move forward. More transactions per second mean more people can use Bitcoin quickly and easily.This Bitcoin collapse scenario can be averted with Bitcoin Core upgrades in the near future. You know what they say. An ounce of prevention beats a pound of cure. Bitcoin masterminds like Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen are on the case and I, for one, am thankful for their proactive approach to Bitcoin’s overall protection. It’s a tough job, but someone’s got to do it.Images from Shutterstock.Do you think Bitcoin can surpass PayPal and Visa in usage?

He advises companies about bitcoin-related regulatory law and represents companies and individuals in civil and criminal proceedings.Here, he discusses what cryptocurrency businesses should consider if they find themselves face-to-face with a US government subpoena, interview or search warrant.Cryptocurrency businesspeople are a hearty bunch. They deal not only with the ordinary anxieties of running a startup, but also with a lack of clarity on a whole range of fundamental legal issues. (Remember when people were still asking whether bitcoin was even legal?)One upshot of this is that a number of companies – including many who have tried hard to comply with applicable laws – have found themselves either receiving investigative subpoenas or subject to civil or criminal enforcement action.The recent Ripple Labs fine, along with comments from FinCEN director Jennifer Shasky Calvery, suggest that this trend is on the upswing.Since regulatory uncertainty is likely to persist for some time, here’s a primer on things to consider when the US government knocks at your door (either figuratively or literally).1. SubpoenasVirtually every US government agency has the power to demand documents from businesses that operate under its regulatory supervision. Generally speaking, the way that the government does this is by issuing a subpoena (sometimes styled as the essentially-identical \'civil investigative demand\').Importantly, while the government doesn\'t need to go to a judge (or anyone else) to issue a subpoena, an agency must go to a judge to enforce a subpoena. That means that when a party doesn’t respond to a subpoena, the agency must first convince a judge that it issued a valid subpoena before anyone will compel the target to produce documents or items.However, when a party ignores a subpoena, the agency likely will go to a judge, and that will almost certainly make things worse. An agency who asks a judge to enforce a subpoena because it has received no response usually gets what it wants, even if the subpoena was overly broad.“US regulatory law is stunningly broad, and the consequences of an investigation gone wrong can be crippling.”Indeed, if there’s a criminal investigation in play, the agency may change its mind and seek a search warrant rather than a subpoena, and raid the offices where it’s looking for files. That’s definitely worse.On the other hand, the fact that subpoenas aren’t self-enforcing also means that they’re negotiable.Most agencies issue cookie-cutter subpoenas, asking for broad and often burdensome productions of documents. Truth be told, those agencies would rather not try to justify an overbroad subpoena to a judge. Just as often, they only issued a broad subpoena because they weren’t sure what they wanted in the first place.The first step that experienced companies usually take after receiving a subpoena is to have their lawyer call the agency to ask what they’re really after. Especially in the cryptocurrency space, where government actors may or may not fully understand the technology, there’s a good chance of getting the government to agree to a \'narrowing letter\', which limits what’s being asked for in the subpoena.Only very seldom can lawyers convince the government to simply go away, but a narrowing letter often saves a lot of time and money by significantly limiting the subpoena’s reach.When a subpoena is truly out of line, parties can also go to court to \'quash\' (or cancel) the subpoena as improper or overly broad. But that’s a lot easier to do when the challenging party is the first one to the judge, and the agency hasn’t already been there complaining about how the target thumbed its nose at them.2. InterviewsUS federal law makes it a felony to intentionally lie to government agents. It’s like being under oath any time you talk to a government agent – except that it’s actually worse: if you testify in a courtroom, a stenographer records your testimony in open court. But when you talk to an FBI agent, the only record of your conversation are the notes that the agent writes up back in their office.So the first problem is obvious: the agent conducting the interview may hear only what they want to hear, or they may simply make honest – but ultimately harmful – mistakes in recording the interview.Moreover, federal agents are permitted to, and regularly do, lie to suspects or witnesses when conducting an investigation. So the mere act of engaging in conversation with an agent can be treacherous.Even if – and maybe especially if – a person has ""nothing to hide"", most defense lawyers will agree that the safest bet when an agent asks for an interview is to treat the agent respectfully and politely, but to decline an interview at that time.A lawyer can then follow up with the agent, and if an interview truly is in the person’s best interest, the lawyer will also arrange to be present for it.3. Search warrantsFinally, in criminal matters, the government sometimes skips subpoenas and gets a search warrant from a court.Unlike a subpoena, a search warrant gives the government the power to search a party’s premises itself and remove items (including computers) listed on the warrant.At the moment agents show up with a search warrant, the target can’t do much to stop the ensuing search. But many parties (and their lawyers) nevertheless stay for the whole search, because staying can help set the stage for what comes next. This is primarily because there are many laws about what constitutes a proper search, and sometimes a party’s eyewitness testimony describing a search can be helpful if the government does something wrong.One risk of staying for the search is that this puts important players in the presence of government agents for a long time, which means that there’s more opportunity for agents to try to engage targets in conversation.The challenge here is not only remaining disciplined about not engaging, but also continuing to be polite to the agents conducting the search. However, this is not an insurmountable task.Another risk of staying for the search is that the government can ask a party who is present for permission to conduct searches beyond what’s in the search warrant. Consenting to that kind of enlargement is not required, and doing so is very seldom worth the associated risk of unintended consequences. Simply knowing this, however, reduces the risk that a party will thoughtlessly consent.With some luck and ingenuity, most cryptocurrency businesses may hope to avoid unwanted government scrutiny. However US regulatory law (and, even more so, criminal law) is stunningly broad, and the consequences of an investigation gone wrong can be crippling.So when luck’s not enough, smart lawyering and some preparation can make the difference between a government investigation that is a mild headache and one that is a train wreck.Disclosure: This is not legal advice, and is not intended to establish an attorney-client relationship.

As a result, you hardly ever see a manufacturer operating one of their own ATM’s these days. This opens opportunities for other companies, whom will gladly purchase one or more machines from a respected manufacturer. EBTM is a Belgian Bitcoin ATM operator, and this is their story.Also Read: The Mt. Gox Post-Bankruptcy Claims: A Detailed GuideBuying From Manufacturers and Operating the MachineSimilar to other companies and individuals around the world, EBTM purchased a Bitcoin ATM from a reputable manufacturer. In order to earn back their initial investment — and hopefully turn a profit — this Belgian Bitcoin company charges a commission of 5% per Bitcoin transaction. That number is in line with most Bitcoin ATM’s around the world, even though some of them charge fees up to 8%.Contrary to popular belief, however, operating one Bitcoin ATM does not guarantee a quick profit. Depending on the location of your machine, you may or may not receive a lot of interest from foot traffic. Belgium is keeping a low profile in terms of Bitcoin adoption and awareness, so operating just this one ATM is not enough for EBTM staff to quit their day job.The Bitcoin ATM located at the Coffeelabs building in Antwerp is manufactured by BitAccess, an up-and-coming ATM manufacturer based in Canada. What makes these devices produced by BitAccess so interesting is that they are two-way Bitcoin ATM’s by design. This allows users to buy and sell Bitcoin in exchange for fiat currency.Of the 5% fee charged per transaction through the Bitcoin ATM operated by EBTM, a small cut goes back to BitAccess. Said cut covers the support behind the scenes, such as software updates, remote access to fix issues and general maintenance. All of the software and API hooks are provided by BitAccess, yet everything can be tweaked to the operator’s liking.“When we were deciding on which manufacturer to choose, two companies were on the top of our list. BitAccess – which became the company we went with – and Robocoin. The deciding factor for us was that Robocoin sell themselves as a bank account, and not a Bitcoin wallet. Furthermore, the Robocoin Bitcoin ATM only accepts USD fiat currency, even in Europe. “ – EBTMEarnings, Limits and LiquidityAs I mentioned before, the EBTM staff is not getting rich overnight from operating one Bitcoin ATM here in Belgium. According to the estimates they provided us with, a total of 7 or 8 ATM’s would be needed in order to make a profit on a regular basis. Quitting day jobs can only happen once the transaction volume picks up drastically.The overall transaction volume has picked up since November of 2014. Statistics indicate there is an even balance between the number of buys and sales. This may be something you would not expect from a Bitcoin ATM, but it is a welcome surprise nonetheless. No exact transaction numbers have been provided at this time.With the number of Bitcoin and fiat currency transactions going up, liquidity becomes an increasingly important factor. On the Bitcoin side, the EBTM-operated Bitcoin ATM is hooked into Bitstamp’s API, which provides enough funds for now. On the side of fiat currency, however, EBTM staff has to travel to Antwerp on a regular basis to feed Euro bills to the machine.As is the case with nearly every Bitcoin ATM around the world, there are certain limits in place when using the machine. Verifying a user’s identity is a key factor for EBTM, even though the local government does not rule Bitcoin as money [yet]. Customers can spend up to 2,000 EUR worth of fiat currency or Bitcoin by verifying their identity. Up to 500 EUR requires you to provide a mobile phone number, and to bypass that limitation, an ID scan is required.The Travelling EBTM MachineIt has to be said, however, that this BitAccess ATM operated by EBTM has seen its fair share of travelling so far. The machine was originally installed in Brussels during a round of beta testing, yet it was moved to Antwerp later on. Right now, the machine is hosted at Coffeelabs’ ground floor, but the ATM will be moved upstairs later this year.Finding a location for a Bitcoin ATM has proven to be a bit of a struggle for EBTM. Business owners are still wary of digital currency, and would rather not get involved in hosting a Bitcoin ATM. However, companies with an interest in new technologies — such as Coffeelabs — are more keen to get involved with Bitcoin.Future PlansThe way things are looking right now, EBTM is looking at buying and installing a second Bitcoin ATM in Belgium. Before that can happen though, the company feels a Bitcoin price increase is needed, as that will influence both media attention and ATM usage. Once people see how the price per Bitcoin goes up again, more customers may be buying digital currency from an EBTM-operated machine.Finding investors to back financially a Bitcoin ATM-related company is difficult these days. Especially when you consider that EBTM is not building these devices themselves, but buying them from a manufacturer. Investing in a company that “only” gets a cut from the transaction fees is not as straightforward as you might think.What do you think about EBTM?

It lets users make payments anonymously, instantly, and without government regulation.The blockchain ledger is accessible to all users of bitcoin, a virtual currency created through a computer “mining” process that uses millions of calculations. Bitcoin has no ties to a central bank and is viewed as an alternative to paying for goods and services with credit cards.A Bitcoin (virtual currency) paper wallet with QR codes and coins are seen in an illustration picture taken at La Maison du Bitcoin in Paris July 11, 2014. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier“We have serious interest in the blockchain and we think the technology would have an impact on the organization,” said Marquez. “The fact that we have such a large group of people working on this shows how serious we are about the potential of this technology.”USAA, which provides banking, insurance and other products to 10.7 million current or former members of the military, owns and manages assets of about $213 billion.Marquez said USAA had no plans to dabble in the bitcoin as a currency.

This is primarily because there are many laws about what constitutes a proper search, and sometimes a party’s eyewitness testimony describing a search can be helpful if the government does something wrong.One risk of staying for the search is that this puts important players in the presence of government agents for a long time, which means that there’s more opportunity for agents to try to engage targets in conversation.The challenge here is not only remaining disciplined about not engaging, but also continuing to be polite to the agents conducting the search. However, this is not an insurmountable task.Another risk of staying for the search is that the government can ask a party who is present for permission to conduct searches beyond what’s in the search warrant. Consenting to that kind of enlargement is not required, and doing so is very seldom worth the associated risk of unintended consequences. Simply knowing this, however, reduces the risk that a party will thoughtlessly consent.With some luck and ingenuity, most cryptocurrency businesses may hope to avoid unwanted government scrutiny. However US regulatory law (and, even more so, criminal law) is stunningly broad, and the consequences of an investigation gone wrong can be crippling.So when luck’s not enough, smart lawyering and some preparation can make the difference between a government investigation that is a mild headache and one that is a train wreck.Disclosure: This is not legal advice, and is not intended to establish an attorney-client relationship.

As a result, you hardly ever see a manufacturer operating one of their own ATM’s these days. This opens opportunities for other companies, whom will gladly purchase one or more machines from a respected manufacturer. EBTM is a Belgian Bitcoin ATM operator, and this is their story.Also Read: The Mt. Gox Post-Bankruptcy Claims: A Detailed GuideBuying From Manufacturers and Operating the MachineSimilar to other companies and individuals around the world, EBTM purchased a Bitcoin ATM from a reputable manufacturer. In order to earn back their initial investment — and hopefully turn a profit — this Belgian Bitcoin company charges a commission of 5% per Bitcoin transaction. That number is in line with most Bitcoin ATM’s around the world, even though some of them charge fees up to 8%.Contrary to popular belief, however, operating one Bitcoin ATM does not guarantee a quick profit. Depending on the location of your machine, you may or may not receive a lot of interest from foot traffic. Belgium is keeping a low profile in terms of Bitcoin adoption and awareness, so operating just this one ATM is not enough for EBTM staff to quit their day job.The Bitcoin ATM located at the Coffeelabs building in Antwerp is manufactured by BitAccess, an up-and-coming ATM manufacturer based in Canada. What makes these devices produced by BitAccess so interesting is that they are two-way Bitcoin ATM’s by design. This allows users to buy and sell Bitcoin in exchange for fiat currency.Of the 5% fee charged per transaction through the Bitcoin ATM operated by EBTM, a small cut goes back to BitAccess. Said cut covers the support behind the scenes, such as software updates, remote access to fix issues and general maintenance. All of the software and API hooks are provided by BitAccess, yet everything can be tweaked to the operator’s liking.“When we were deciding on which manufacturer to choose, two companies were on the top of our list. BitAccess – which became the company we went with – and Robocoin. The deciding factor for us was that Robocoin sell themselves as a bank account, and not a Bitcoin wallet. Furthermore, the Robocoin Bitcoin ATM only accepts USD fiat currency, even in Europe. “ – EBTMEarnings, Limits and LiquidityAs I mentioned before, the EBTM staff is not getting rich overnight from operating one Bitcoin ATM here in Belgium. According to the estimates they provided us with, a total of 7 or 8 ATM’s would be needed in order to make a profit on a regular basis. Quitting day jobs can only happen once the transaction volume picks up drastically.The overall transaction volume has picked up since November of 2014. Statistics indicate there is an even balance between the number of buys and sales. This may be something you would not expect from a Bitcoin ATM, but it is a welcome surprise nonetheless. No exact transaction numbers have been provided at this time.With the number of Bitcoin and fiat currency transactions going up, liquidity becomes an increasingly important factor. On the Bitcoin side, the EBTM-operated Bitcoin ATM is hooked into Bitstamp’s API, which provides enough funds for now. On the side of fiat currency, however, EBTM staff has to travel to Antwerp on a regular basis to feed Euro bills to the machine.As is the case with nearly every Bitcoin ATM around the world, there are certain limits in place when using the machine. Verifying a user’s identity is a key factor for EBTM, even though the local government does not rule Bitcoin as money [yet]. Customers can spend up to 2,000 EUR worth of fiat currency or Bitcoin by verifying their identity. Up to 500 EUR requires you to provide a mobile phone number, and to bypass that limitation, an ID scan is required.The Travelling EBTM MachineIt has to be said, however, that this BitAccess ATM operated by EBTM has seen its fair share of travelling so far. The machine was originally installed in Brussels during a round of beta testing, yet it was moved to Antwerp later on. Right now, the machine is hosted at Coffeelabs’ ground floor, but the ATM will be moved upstairs later this year.Finding a location for a Bitcoin ATM has proven to be a bit of a struggle for EBTM. Business owners are still wary of digital currency, and would rather not get involved in hosting a Bitcoin ATM. However, companies with an interest in new technologies — such as Coffeelabs — are more keen to get involved with Bitcoin.Future PlansThe way things are looking right now, EBTM is looking at buying and installing a second Bitcoin ATM in Belgium. Before that can happen though, the company feels a Bitcoin price increase is needed, as that will influence both media attention and ATM usage. Once people see how the price per Bitcoin goes up again, more customers may be buying digital currency from an EBTM-operated machine.Finding investors to back financially a Bitcoin ATM-related company is difficult these days. Especially when you consider that EBTM is not building these devices themselves, but buying them from a manufacturer. Investing in a company that “only” gets a cut from the transaction fees is not as straightforward as you might think.What do you think about EBTM?

05/17/2015,"['The obvious question about bitcoins is who invented them. The obvious answer – certainly obvious to me – is that it was not Satoshi Nakamoto. For sure the arcane treatise that launched the bitcoin concept was authored by a person of this Japanese-sounding name. But after nearly 27 years watching the world from a base in Tokyo, I claim some understanding of Japanese culture: my strong instinct is that Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym for someone who is anything but Japanese. Japan is far too regulated for the sort of “freelance activity” involved here. And if Japanese citizens took part at a corporate or governmental level, they would present their role in quite a different manner – taking fully traceable credit if they were proud of their role.All in all, I am convinced that Nathaniel Popper of the New York Times got it right last week in naming Nick Szabo, a Hungarian-American former student at George Washington University, as the real inventor. But this only raises further questions.Here are some of them:', 'A recent series of busts has shaken the world of dark net weapons commerce. A six-month joint investigation between law enforcement in Australia and the United States, which involved law enforcement going undercover as weapons dealers, has resulted in 17 arrests internationally.In September 2014, the US Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) identified a 33-year-old US-based dark net seller of weapons to a “worldwide client base,” according to a press release from the Australian Federal Police (AFP).The arrest came as the result of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) providing “relevant information” to HSI, “[commencing] a covert operation using the online alias account” in order to identify users trying to buy illegal weapons.Security researcher Gwern Branwen has been following the investigation since April and believes he knows the user account of the arrested weapons seller that was used by HSI. His evidence was posted on DarknetMarkets Subreddit.In April, the US Department of Justice arrested US-based Justin Moreira, 21, and charged him with the purchase of a Walther PPK/S .380 calibre pistol and a silencer from a federal undercover agent sometime after January 2015 for about $2,500 in bitcoin, according to a DoJ press release.According to the criminal complaint, Moreira used the acount “jd497” to purchase the weapon.The account was on dark net marketplace Agora, where the the username “weaponsguy,” according to Branwen, was used by law enforcement. The guns, at least according to the UPS tracking number, were shipped from Montana.HSI agents used the account to complete six sales made to addresses in Australia. 15 search warrants were received through February and March, leading to the arrest of four suspects.The all male suspects include a 25-year-old from Liverpool, New South Wales; a 26-year-old from Gladstone, Queensland; and a 24-year-old and 25-year-old from the Australian Capital Territories, all of whom will appear in court June 25.[divider]CCN[/divider]34 charges have been brought against the suspects, covering many offenses, not all weapons related.“Four illegal firearms, ammunition, two clandestine laboratories, precursor chemicals, methamphetamines, pseudoephedrine, steroids, computer equipment and mobile telephones were seized,” according to AFP.“On a global level, the operation led to 17 arrests across the United Kingdom, Europe and North America. These arrests resulted in the further seizures of firearms, ballistic armor, illicit drugs and $80,000 in bitcoins,” a Customs statement said.An agent close to the investigation clarified to the Australian authorities commitment that they will strike down on dark net weapons sales.“HSI will maintain its unrelenting commitment to secure land borders as well as virtual borders from individuals seeking to prosper from the sale and/or purchase of firearms, drugs, and other illicit items with little regard for national security,” special agent in charge of HSI Newark Kevin Kelly said.“Anyone who mistakenly thinks that they can get away with these types of crimes by hiding in the endless depths of the internet must know that HSI will seek them out and bring them to justice.”According to authorities, this investigation highlights the success law enforcement can have when investigating dark net based illicit activity.“Despite this great result, Customs and Border Protection will continue to actively monitor and target illicit transnational online trade, and this operation highlights the fact that our efforts are supported by national and international law enforcement partners,” CBPS National Director Investigations, Assistant Commissioner Lancaster said.“People using these sites should not be fooled by claims of online anonymity; each transaction builds up a global web of intelligence which international partners are using to target you.”Advertisement:', '?? ????? ??? ????????? ?????????? ??? ??? ?????????? ??? ????????? ??? ??????? - ??????????? ?? ??????? ???? ?????????? ??? «????????? ??????????» (Bitcoin) ???? ?????????? ????????? - ???????? ??? ???????? ??? ???????? ??? ??? ??????????? ??? «?????? ???????»????? ?????????: ? ???????? ??? ?. ????? ????????? ???? ??????? ????? ???

It was invented by Chris Ellis from World Crypto Network and Bitnation founder Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, who I met at a meetup last October.Citizen of the blockchainWith a group of people from the meetup that could confirm my existence in time and space, we documented it with photos, signed it with PGP keys, time-stamped and hashed it, and put it on the blockchain. The PGP encryption and the blockchain make the ID secure.The event made me feel honored and also responsible to promote what is possible with the blockchain, such as providing infrastructure like land registry in developing countries, comparable to how MPesa enabled people to leapfrog banks. Therefore, a few weeks afterwards, I invented Blockchain Girl, which I use to spread everything from my interaction with the blockchain to whatever else I see as important.People can create their own blockchain IDs themselves to mutually verify their existence. This is useful if you have some misgivings about being documented by the state or if it is not possible to do so in a normal way; for example, in war zones, for stateless people, when there is a lack of infrastructure, or - as it is up to you which data you include, like full name, address, photo etc. - for persecutes and refugees.All tools are available and the steps of creating a blockchain ID are explained by Chris Ellis and at Bitnation`s Github. Everyone with an internet connection would have equal access to such transparent services on the blockchain, irrespective of the country they happen to be born in. The blockchain could be used to better organize libertarian or local communities like seasteading or the new Liberland state. The efficacy, accuracy and lower price to maintain this system can potentially disrupt traditional governments, similar to how Bitcoin is disrupting traditional finance.Ideally, blockchain IDs would be voluntarily created by private individuals for low cost, so people everywhere could create and mutually sign their IDs. Instead of being backed by government, the ID’s strength would be based on the social network that supports it.The blockchain ID will form the basis of the coming Bitnation-Blocknet-Horizon platform, Bitnation Pangea: When people register, they will get a blockchain ID and are part of a reputation system on the blockchain, comparable to Ebay. People will be able to have different accounts for different aspects of life, so they can have several blockchain IDs for work, travel etc.‘Blockchain Baby’In the meantime, there has been another blockchain ID created to serve as the birth certificate for the founder’s nephew, “Blockchain Baby” Sion.Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof explained:“My brother and I were born in the same country, to the same parents. Yet, we had different nationalities - and now - 30 years on - we still have different nationalities. It boggled my mind that these arbitrary lines drawn in the sand would dictate what rights we had in life. Hence, being able to create a birth certificate for my brother’s son, and my Godson, baby Sion, on the blockchain was a significant event - at last a solution that treats every person as equal, regardless for where in the world they’ve been born.""If you are further interested, you can look into the other blockchain projects at Github, see how the blockchain can be useful for your country, join our ambassador network, and meet me at the many blockchain related meetups in London.', 'CLOSE Emerging financial technologies has Wall Street companies worried that if they don’t asses the threat they could suffer from similar disruption problems that have plagued publishing, retail and travel industries. Kaja Whitehouse reports. Michael Monday and Kaja WhitehouseThe Wall Street subway stop in New York\'s financial district. (Photo: Richard Drew, AP)The next big acquisition craze could result in more khakis-wearing tech geeks on Wall Street.Technologies that compete with traditional banking businesses, like bitcoin and computer-generated investment advice, have Wall Street worried they will soon face the same disruption issues that have plagued retail, travel and publishing industries. The emerging financial tech industry, dubbed fintech, now threatens to grab $4.7 trillion in revenue and $470 billion in profits from traditional Wall Street firms, Goldman Sachs recently predicted.The good news for Silicon Valley is that deep-pocketed Wall Street firms will seek to stave off the competition by throwing money at the space through investments and acquisitions, experts said.Aberdeen Asset Management, which manages $500 billion in assets, recently tasked its board\'s innovation committee to study the problem and to scout for financial technologies to buy, said co-founder and CEO Martin Gilbert.""My point is, let\'s not be complacent about this,"" Gilbert said. ""Let\'s not assume that Google is not going to enter asset management because it\'s a regulated industry.""Aberdeen is not alone. In January, the New York Stock Exchange announced a strategic investment in Coinbase, a bitcoin wallet provider. And last month, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that ""Silicon Valley is coming"" in a letter to shareholders.""There are hundreds of start-ups with a lot of brains and money working on various alternatives to traditional banking,"" Dimon wrote in the letter, which sought to reassure investors that the behemoth bank is prepared to deal with the problem.Anand Sanwal, CEO of CB Insights, which researches private companies for interested investors, predicts Wall Street investments and acquisitions in financial technology start-ups will take off in the next ""18 months and beyond.""""Right now we\'re in the awareness phase,"" Sanwal said. Companies that fail to act risk ""death by a thousand cuts,"" he added.Gilbert said Aberdeen is interested in technologies that will allow clients to manage their portfolios and trade electronically. Other technologies that have piqued Wall Street\'s interest include newfangled lending platforms, such as LendingClub, electronic payment systems, such as bitcoin, and computer-generated investing advice, such as Wealthfront.*Alternative lending platforms, which often match non-bank lenders to borrowers, are doing well in part because they are popular with small-business owners, which can have a tough time borrowing from banks. In January, for example, alternative lenders generated 62% of all small-business loans, compared to just 21% by big banks, Goldman said in a recent series of reports about the impact emerging technologies on the financial services industry.*New payments systems like bitcoin threaten traditional banking because they allow people to transfer money faster and with lower fees than banks. The industry could cost banks $84 billion, Goldman said in the same research series.*Start-ups like Wealthfront and Betterment compete with brokers and wealth managers by providing cheaper, computer-generated investment advice. The two companies collectively boast more than $3 billion in assets under management.Cast members of TV\'s ""Silicon Valley"": Zach Woods, left, T.J.

The obvious answer – certainly obvious to me – is that it was not Satoshi Nakamoto. For sure the arcane treatise that launched the bitcoin concept was authored by a person of this Japanese-sounding name. But after nearly 27 years watching the world from a base in Tokyo, I claim some understanding of Japanese culture: my strong instinct is that Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym for someone who is anything but Japanese. Japan is far too regulated for the sort of “freelance activity” involved here. And if Japanese citizens took part at a corporate or governmental level, they would present their role in quite a different manner – taking fully traceable credit if they were proud of their role.All in all, I am convinced that Nathaniel Popper of the New York Times got it right last week in naming Nick Szabo, a Hungarian-American former student at George Washington University, as the real inventor. But this only raises further questions.Here are some of them:', 'A recent series of busts has shaken the world of dark net weapons commerce. A six-month joint investigation between law enforcement in Australia and the United States, which involved law enforcement going undercover as weapons dealers, has resulted in 17 arrests internationally.In September 2014, the US Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) identified a 33-year-old US-based dark net seller of weapons to a “worldwide client base,” according to a press release from the Australian Federal Police (AFP).The arrest came as the result of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) providing “relevant information” to HSI, “[commencing] a covert operation using the online alias account” in order to identify users trying to buy illegal weapons.Security researcher Gwern Branwen has been following the investigation since April and believes he knows the user account of the arrested weapons seller that was used by HSI. His evidence was posted on DarknetMarkets Subreddit.In April, the US Department of Justice arrested US-based Justin Moreira, 21, and charged him with the purchase of a Walther PPK/S .380 calibre pistol and a silencer from a federal undercover agent sometime after January 2015 for about $2,500 in bitcoin, according to a DoJ press release.According to the criminal complaint, Moreira used the acount “jd497” to purchase the weapon.The account was on dark net marketplace Agora, where the the username “weaponsguy,” according to Branwen, was used by law enforcement. The guns, at least according to the UPS tracking number, were shipped from Montana.HSI agents used the account to complete six sales made to addresses in Australia. 15 search warrants were received through February and March, leading to the arrest of four suspects.The all male suspects include a 25-year-old from Liverpool, New South Wales; a 26-year-old from Gladstone, Queensland; and a 24-year-old and 25-year-old from the Australian Capital Territories, all of whom will appear in court June 25.[divider]CCN[/divider]34 charges have been brought against the suspects, covering many offenses, not all weapons related.“Four illegal firearms, ammunition, two clandestine laboratories, precursor chemicals, methamphetamines, pseudoephedrine, steroids, computer equipment and mobile telephones were seized,” according to AFP.“On a global level, the operation led to 17 arrests across the United Kingdom, Europe and North America. These arrests resulted in the further seizures of firearms, ballistic armor, illicit drugs and $80,000 in bitcoins,” a Customs statement said.An agent close to the investigation clarified to the Australian authorities commitment that they will strike down on dark net weapons sales.“HSI will maintain its unrelenting commitment to secure land borders as well as virtual borders from individuals seeking to prosper from the sale and/or purchase of firearms, drugs, and other illicit items with little regard for national security,” special agent in charge of HSI Newark Kevin Kelly said.“Anyone who mistakenly thinks that they can get away with these types of crimes by hiding in the endless depths of the internet must know that HSI will seek them out and bring them to justice.”According to authorities, this investigation highlights the success law enforcement can have when investigating dark net based illicit activity.“Despite this great result, Customs and Border Protection will continue to actively monitor and target illicit transnational online trade, and this operation highlights the fact that our efforts are supported by national and international law enforcement partners,” CBPS National Director Investigations, Assistant Commissioner Lancaster said.“People using these sites should not be fooled by claims of online anonymity; each transaction builds up a global web of intelligence which international partners are using to target you.”Advertisement:', '?? ????? ??? ????????? ?????????? ??? ??? ?????????? ??? ????????? ??? ??????? - ??????????? ?? ??????? ???? ?????????? ??? «????????? ??????????» (Bitcoin) ???? ?????????? ????????? - ???????? ??? ???????? ??? ???????? ??? ??? ??????????? ??? «?????? ???????»????? ?????????: ? ???????? ??? ?. ????? ????????? ???? ??????? ????? ???

It was invented by Chris Ellis from World Crypto Network and Bitnation founder Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, who I met at a meetup last October.Citizen of the blockchainWith a group of people from the meetup that could confirm my existence in time and space, we documented it with photos, signed it with PGP keys, time-stamped and hashed it, and put it on the blockchain. The PGP encryption and the blockchain make the ID secure.The event made me feel honored and also responsible to promote what is possible with the blockchain, such as providing infrastructure like land registry in developing countries, comparable to how MPesa enabled people to leapfrog banks. Therefore, a few weeks afterwards, I invented Blockchain Girl, which I use to spread everything from my interaction with the blockchain to whatever else I see as important.People can create their own blockchain IDs themselves to mutually verify their existence. This is useful if you have some misgivings about being documented by the state or if it is not possible to do so in a normal way; for example, in war zones, for stateless people, when there is a lack of infrastructure, or - as it is up to you which data you include, like full name, address, photo etc. - for persecutes and refugees.All tools are available and the steps of creating a blockchain ID are explained by Chris Ellis and at Bitnation`s Github. Everyone with an internet connection would have equal access to such transparent services on the blockchain, irrespective of the country they happen to be born in. The blockchain could be used to better organize libertarian or local communities like seasteading or the new Liberland state. The efficacy, accuracy and lower price to maintain this system can potentially disrupt traditional governments, similar to how Bitcoin is disrupting traditional finance.Ideally, blockchain IDs would be voluntarily created by private individuals for low cost, so people everywhere could create and mutually sign their IDs. Instead of being backed by government, the ID’s strength would be based on the social network that supports it.The blockchain ID will form the basis of the coming Bitnation-Blocknet-Horizon platform, Bitnation Pangea: When people register, they will get a blockchain ID and are part of a reputation system on the blockchain, comparable to Ebay. People will be able to have different accounts for different aspects of life, so they can have several blockchain IDs for work, travel etc.‘Blockchain Baby’In the meantime, there has been another blockchain ID created to serve as the birth certificate for the founder’s nephew, “Blockchain Baby” Sion.Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof explained:“My brother and I were born in the same country, to the same parents. Yet, we had different nationalities - and now - 30 years on - we still have different nationalities. It boggled my mind that these arbitrary lines drawn in the sand would dictate what rights we had in life. Hence, being able to create a birth certificate for my brother’s son, and my Godson, baby Sion, on the blockchain was a significant event - at last a solution that treats every person as equal, regardless for where in the world they’ve been born.""If you are further interested, you can look into the other blockchain projects at Github, see how the blockchain can be useful for your country, join our ambassador network, and meet me at the many blockchain related meetups in London.', 'CLOSE Emerging financial technologies has Wall Street companies worried that if they don’t asses the threat they could suffer from similar disruption problems that have plagued publishing, retail and travel industries. Kaja Whitehouse reports. Michael Monday and Kaja WhitehouseThe Wall Street subway stop in New York\'s financial district. (Photo: Richard Drew, AP)The next big acquisition craze could result in more khakis-wearing tech geeks on Wall Street.Technologies that compete with traditional banking businesses, like bitcoin and computer-generated investment advice, have Wall Street worried they will soon face the same disruption issues that have plagued retail, travel and publishing industries. The emerging financial tech industry, dubbed fintech, now threatens to grab $4.7 trillion in revenue and $470 billion in profits from traditional Wall Street firms, Goldman Sachs recently predicted.The good news for Silicon Valley is that deep-pocketed Wall Street firms will seek to stave off the competition by throwing money at the space through investments and acquisitions, experts said.Aberdeen Asset Management, which manages $500 billion in assets, recently tasked its board\'s innovation committee to study the problem and to scout for financial technologies to buy, said co-founder and CEO Martin Gilbert.""My point is, let\'s not be complacent about this,"" Gilbert said. ""Let\'s not assume that Google is not going to enter asset management because it\'s a regulated industry.""Aberdeen is not alone. In January, the New York Stock Exchange announced a strategic investment in Coinbase, a bitcoin wallet provider. And last month, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that ""Silicon Valley is coming"" in a letter to shareholders.""There are hundreds of start-ups with a lot of brains and money working on various alternatives to traditional banking,"" Dimon wrote in the letter, which sought to reassure investors that the behemoth bank is prepared to deal with the problem.Anand Sanwal, CEO of CB Insights, which researches private companies for interested investors, predicts Wall Street investments and acquisitions in financial technology start-ups will take off in the next ""18 months and beyond.""""Right now we\'re in the awareness phase,"" Sanwal said. Companies that fail to act risk ""death by a thousand cuts,"" he added.Gilbert said Aberdeen is interested in technologies that will allow clients to manage their portfolios and trade electronically. Other technologies that have piqued Wall Street\'s interest include newfangled lending platforms, such as LendingClub, electronic payment systems, such as bitcoin, and computer-generated investing advice, such as Wealthfront.*Alternative lending platforms, which often match non-bank lenders to borrowers, are doing well in part because they are popular with small-business owners, which can have a tough time borrowing from banks. In January, for example, alternative lenders generated 62% of all small-business loans, compared to just 21% by big banks, Goldman said in a recent series of reports about the impact emerging technologies on the financial services industry.*New payments systems like bitcoin threaten traditional banking because they allow people to transfer money faster and with lower fees than banks. The industry could cost banks $84 billion, Goldman said in the same research series.*Start-ups like Wealthfront and Betterment compete with brokers and wealth managers by providing cheaper, computer-generated investment advice. The two companies collectively boast more than $3 billion in assets under management.Cast members of TV\'s ""Silicon Valley"": Zach Woods, left, T.J.

06/28/2015,"[""Matthew Roberts and Elías Snær Einarsson, two developers who have been active in the crypto space, recently proposed and published a new technology known as timechain.Simply put, the timechain is a chain of keys that can be used by anyone to encrypt any information for a certain period of time. It introduces proper incentives for the people who create and maintain the chain, hence the system is considered a decentralized autonomous company (DAC).The idea received quite some attention, as it claims to offer genuine security improvements for the crypto space. A lot of people have made attempts to use the element of time in cryptography, as it can solve many daily problems. Think of a trustless auction where people’s bids are revealed after a specific amount of time without relying on any third party.But how can we tie cryptography, the science of secrets, with time?Cryptography and TimeMachines, despite being fast compared to humans, require a processing time for completing actions. A more complicated process results in more computations by a machine, which obviously requires more time to be completed. One good example can be bitcoin mining, which requires roughly 10 minutes for miners to compute the puzzle and propose a block to the blockchain.So assuming we use a known input and generate an output using this complicated, long-running process like continuous hashing (Hashing is perfect since it’s a one way function and can’t be inverted) by machines and then use the generated output as an input in the science of cryptography, for example using the output as a cryptographic key to encrypt information.Once the encryption is completed, if we can get rid of the output that was generated earlier, we are only left with that known input, with which we started off. Decrypting that information can only be done with the output that we got rid of and the only way to generate that output now is to apply that long-running process again to the input.Therefore, now we can consider our information time-locked. The time that is required to unlock that information is the time needed to generate that output again. This is the basic concept time-locked encryption that was proposed in 1996 by Rivest and Shamir (two of the well-known cartographers of all time).Time-lock encryption has two steps. First step is to time-lock an input using a long-running process and the second step is to redo that process to achieve the same number again. The first step can be done using parallel processing concurrently to speed the process up whereas the second step can only be done in sequence to find the right output.So now the question is who’s going to perform this long running process?Maintaining the TimechainTimechain creates a process that anyone can participate in, just like mining, and generates a chain of locked numbers roughly every five minutes. The incentive for participant is a fee that is paid by those who want to use the service.CoinTelegraph asked Matthew Roberts about who initially maintains the timechain and what problems can it solve initially. He said:“To start with: we are. We're building the timechain to solve a very specific problem with smart contracts called transaction malleability. TX malleability effects refund protocols in smart contracts, and in order to fix them you have to rely on third parties to hold private keys. The timechain allows us to provide a refund service for our smart contracts (or anyone’s) which can't be hacked because of how the service is enforced.”But how do we make sure that those who create these outputs are throwing them away and not storing them? There is no guarantee that those who generate the output using hash functions will delete them. Roberts replied:“If the service in question wants to keep parts of the timechain around, they can, but it would defeat the security benefits of using a timechain and that wouldn't make much sense to spend so much money on computations and then not generate the timechain correctly. That's not to say that a single timechain should be trusted. In the ideal scenario, you would use your own timechain for things like wallets, and companies would each generate their own. But if you absolutely have to, you can always use a threshold scheme where information is encrypted with multiple timechains in such a way that a threshold can fail without being able to compromise the time-lock.”Roberts continued by mentioning a few other problems with the current paper. “There's a few more problems left with the timechain that will be fixed in v2 of the paper, like the double-spend problem with financial incentives and our messy blockchain idea,” he said. “Not big issues, just requires us to propagate rewards up the chain and gives the first person who gets to a reward the ability to hide it for around 10 minutes, so they have chance to claim it before another person arrives.”Ultimately timechain addresses a few security issues and tries to solve these problems by using time-lock encryption and creating a decentralized autonomous corporation with the right incentives for its maintainers to build these time-locked keys.While it still has a few technical challenges, it certainly holds a lot of promise and we need to wait to see the second paper describing their practical system before judging this technology."", ""Continuing the search for secure, cross-platform, end-to-end encrypted chat and VoIP communication software, this article is part 2 of a series on encrypted Skype alternatives.Skype, Microsoft's voice over IP (VoIP) software, has been shown to be insecure on various levels over the years. The Snowden leaks have revealed it to be more of a mass surveillance malware than a secure communications platform.Secure communications like those between you and a friend as you sip coffee in your backyard are the ideal of end-to-end (E2E) encrypted online communications.We want the same security, if not more, while talking to coworkers, friends or even strangers, from anywhere around the world. This is without a doubt a big challenge, especially when governments around the world are actively snooping and subtly trying to break into the mass communications of the general public.Snowden’s RecommendationsIf anyone ever needed to be certain that their communications were completely secure, it was Edward Snowden. He successfully retrieved a massive amount of top secret information from the the NSA, the publicly funded and supposedly accountable government agency. He then proceeded to blow the whistle by handing the information over to professional journalists. To do this, he had to use the best and most secure communications technology available, some of which he has since shared with the public.The first, is PGP. It stands for Pretty Good Privacy and it uses a public and private key architecture that is intended to prove that whoever you are talking to is actually who they claim to be. It can also encrypt information in such a way that only those with whom you choose to share information can read it. PGP has been the gold standard of online, secure communications for over 20 years, but it has some weaknesses. Most notably, if your private keys are compromised, all your previous communications could be decrypted. It also has a significant learning curve.Next up is OTR, which stands for Off-the-Record encryption. This technology continues the work of PGP developers by providing end-to-end encryption for text communications, but delivering where PGP is left wanting. “Perfect forward secrecy” is one of OTR's essential assets, and as the name suggests, it encrypts every communication with a different key, so if one of your keys is compromised, not all of your communications can be decrypted. OTR is the protocol Glenn Greenwald used to communicate with Snowden and coordinate the leak.OTR stands out as one of the pieces of software that, as far as the Snowden documents go, super power government agencies can't decrypt or bypass, at least sometimes.Spiegel International, the German newspaper, has gone into detail about the known capabilities of the Five Eyes spying coalition, as well as the limits of their prying power.The Intercept reported on how Snowden and Greenwald smuggled the top secret documents past the most sophisticated digital surveillance system ever imagined.Jitsi and Pidgin, the 'Browsers' of Secure ChatPGP and OTR cannot be used on their own, as they are only authentication and encryption protocols. To use them, you need some kind of communication client. Jitsi is often considered one of the best clients around. Think of Jitsi as a Bitcoin wallet and OTR. The of PGP as Bitcoin or Litecoin.Jitsi can be thought of a browser for chat, VoIP and video calls. It is fairly feature rich and can be connected to send and receive communications simultaneously from a wide variety of platforms such as Facebook, Google Chat, Slack, IRC, Jabber, XMPP and many more. Most importantly, it comes with OTR and ZRTP (real-time transport protocol) built in. ZRTP enables secure, real-time VoIP encryption and was created by Phil Zimmerman (hence the Z in ZRTP).While the Jitsi client no doubt presents a great effort towards making secure communications easy to use, it still requires a significant amount of tech savvy to set up VoIP and end-to-end encryption on it. If you want to use it for E2E encrypted communications, therefore, I would categorize it as advanced in difficulty. It can also be unstable at times.Once you figure out how to establish secure end-to-end encrypted communications with another party, then you can actually send messages through Facebook or even Google Chat, and they will appear as encrypted communications to anyone but you and the receiver.Why not connect Jitsi to Skype? Well, because Skype is closed-source and will actively close or block any attempts to interact with its protocol. You can thank Microsoft and the NSA for that.I could also find no way to integrate Tox.im, a favorite among Skype alternatives, with Jitsi. However, there is a plugin under pre-alpha development that will allow the use of Tox with Pidgin.Pidgin is a chat client very similar to Jitsi, the difference being that it does not come with OTR or ZRTP installed natively and they must be added as a plugins.Pidgin and Jitsi are available on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. Jitsi has an Android version under development.MobileIn the land of mobile E2E VoIP apps, RedPhone is easily one of the most popular, with over 7,000 downloads. Designed by Open Whisper Systems, the app features end-to-end encryption using ZRTP and SRTP (secure real-time transfer protocol) for-real time encryption. It is all open source, though unfortunately, it is not compatible with other implementations of ZRTP.Their website proudly boasts recommendations from Snowden and Matt Green, legendary Cryptographer at John Hopkins University.Honorable MentionsOther projects worth mentioning are MegaChat, by prominent activist and entrepreneur Kim Dotcom. The platform boasts end-to-end encryption, leveraging a similar technology as their cloud service. They have been actively engaging the security community's criticisms and feedback since launch.MegaChat only supports one-to-one video and audio calls on fully featured browsers as of this time. However, the team said they are working on secure group calls, as well as chat. We may even see mobile support at some point to accompany their cloud storage mobile app.Another option is the Guardian Project, an organization putting out massive amounts of open-source privacy software with a strong focus on mobile. Their apps include mobile access to Tor, ChatSecure, a chat app that also implements OTR and many more.Last but not least, there's RaKeTu, which claims to offer encrypted VoIP and chat on all major platforms except Linux (which they say is coming soon). The company is not specific about what types of encryption they use, however, and do not mention any of the recognized standards of encryption mentioned above. They are also, for the time being, closed source. They do, however, have a hilarious intro video.ConclusionsOne of the unconquered frontiers of E2E secure communications is group chat and calls. It is also one of Skype's most predominant technologies. Developers will have to climb this hill and set their flag in order to attract a larger audience or whole communities to their products. Let’s hope they replace Facebook Groups while they are at it.Given how many startups and companies are trying to fill the void of truly secure online communications, it will also be hard to find an app that a majority of people use. Unfortunately, interoperability among many of these apps is as a general rule lacking. This is similar to the altcoin space today, and means one dominant player may have to rise to the top, creating a massive encrypted city, rather than small villages with encrypted tunnels between them."", 'While developers around the world are discovering potential sue cases for blockchain technology, security analysts have disclosed multiple SSH key vulnerabilities plaguing Cisco’s network security virtual appliances. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could give hackers unlimited access to these virtual appliances.Also read Popular Android Apps Vulnerable to HTTPS Bug, More Education on Technology Needed?Cisco’s Two SSH VulnerabilitiesCisco is one the world’s leading companies as far as networking capabilities is concerned. With most of our technology taking on a cloud platform allure, Cisco has developed network security virtual appliances for different use cases. However, an SSH vulnerability was discovered, because virtual machines running on VMWare and KVM virtualization platforms share a default authorized SSH key.Originally, these pre-authorized SSH keys were intended for “customer support” level of access only. However, if these keys were to be used for malicious purposes, they will grant an intruder unlimited access and control. Services affected include Cisco Web Security Virtual Appliance, Email Security Virtual Appliance, and Security Management Virtual Appliance.On June 25, Cisco released an advisory on the SSH vulnerability, which stated:“IP address connectivity to the management interface on the affected platform is the only requirement for the products to be exposed to this vulnerability. No additional configuration is required for this vulnerability to be exploited.”In saying so, Cisco admits that an attacker would only need to obtain one type of SSH key from any of their virtual appliances. Once that SSH key has been obtained, the attacker can access any [unpatched] virtual appliance reachable over the internet, regardless of its location or purpose.To make matters even worse, a second SSH vulnerability was discovered shortly afterwards. The aforementioned virtual appliances are vulnerable due to a “pre-installed set of SSH host keys that allow access to communication secured by those keys.” These pre-installed SSH host keys are put in place to protect appliance-to-appliance communication.“Because all deployments of WSAv or ESAv use the same set of default SSH host keys, accessing any of the private keys on a single deployment could allow an attacker to decrypt communication on WSAv, ESAv, or SMAv. An attacker with possession of compromised keys, who is able to intercept traffic between the WSAv or ESAv and a host it is communicating with, would be able to decrypt the communication with a man-in-the-middle attack.”Security Remains Key, In Both Old & New TechnologyBitcoin and blockchain technology are often scrutinized for their lack of security. But these security vulnerabilities on Cisco virtual appliances are a strong indication that security is always a concern, f or both old and new technology. Plus, these vulnerabilities give blockchain developers a new idea for a use case of this disruptive technology to improve the security features we use to this very day.What are your thoughts on these Cisco SSH vulnerabilities?

With the Greek stock exchange closed and banks imposing a bank holiday on Monday, the European Central Bank refusing to expand emergency loans and creditors rejecting a bailout extension for the country, investors will be urgently assessing whether the fallout will be limited to Greece — or become a global event. Bonds Fears of a eurozone break-up during the 2011-12 crisis played out in the government bond markets of southern eurozone “periphery” countries, and a significant jump in Spanish, Italian and Portuguese bond yields on Monday would be a clear sign that investors are once again taking the possibility of contagion seriously. If that is the case, expect to see a flight to safety, with investors selling out of Europe’s riskiest assets in favour of the relative security of bonds issued by Germany. Government borrowing costs in “core” Europe could drop while those in the periphery rise, increasing the spread between the two. Worries about waning liquidity across markets could further exacerbate volatility in the event of a sell-off. But if the difference between the spread increases by up to 20 or 30 basis points it will mean contagion is viewed as manageable rather than wholesale, says Steve Englander, strategist at Citigroup. Even a jump of as much as 50 basis points would still leave the countries with historically low borrowing rates — and much lower than during 2011-12. Keeping a lid on yields will be eurozone “quantitative easing”. Since the ECB decided to follow in the footsteps of central banks in the US, UK and Japan by implementing an aggressive bond-buying programme this year, prices for bonds issued across the eurozone have jumped, pushing yields to record lows. In contrast, prices of Greek government bonds, which are not part of the QE programme, have collapsed. They are likely to fall further into distressed territory when Greek markets reopen. Equities Images of bank customers queueing to remove their money are likely to foreshadow a sell-off in Greek bank stocks, which would weigh heavily on the Athens stock exchange when markets reopen to investors. Across the world, share indices will act as gauges of investor views on the seriousness of the problems in Greece for other markets. Simon Derrick, currency strategist at BNY Mellon, says: “The risk is\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009that the Asian and European sessions are characterised by abrupt and substantial price moves.” Crucial for investors in Europe will be whether Greece will blow off course the eurozone’s gradual economic recovery. Some argue steps taken since 2011-12 have increased its resilience significantly. Erik Nielsen, chief economist at UniCredit, said in a note on Sunday: “I know that the safe bet is to predict disaster when you think through an unprecedented event, but I truly struggle to see why a Greek disaster should have more than limited and temporary effects on the rest of Europe. “My bottom line is this: if European risky assets sell off on the news of a Greek political suicide attempt, I’ll be a buyer on any material dip.” Currency Europe’s single currency has proved remarkably resilient to the drama in Greece so far. Whether this is because investors refuse to take the idea of a Greek exit seriously or believe the region is strong enough to withstand a default and ejection is not clear. Aurelija Augulyte, analyst at Nordea, says: “Many have been puzzled about [the euro] firming lately\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009making people believe [it] is a safe haven now. Is it, really? Probably not as safe at it seems — or not for long.” Formed in 1999, the euro enjoyed a decade of stability before the eurozone debt crisis began in 2010. Some contrarians believe the currency bloc will be stronger again without Greece. If so, the country’s ejection could even see the euro climbing again. Markets are at a critical juncture and significant euro weakness is highly likely, says Kit Juckes, analyst at Société Générale. “Risk aversion is likely to spread and despite the PBoC [People’s Bank of China] easing in China, we are likely to see a strong dollar, and a stronger yen, across the board in the next few days.” A yen for cherry blossoms and safety Play video Beat Siegenthaler, global macro adviser at UBS, says investors will weigh up whether the situation in Greece is a full-scale “risk-off” event or a bump in the road towards a global recovery. “Strong risk-off would probably boost dollar safe-haven demand despite US yields dropping,” Mr Siegenthaler says. “If seen just as a delay in normalisation then the dollar might go lower as investors temporarily close out of consensus positions.”', 'Bargeld ist ein Anachronismus, den abzuschaffen, ein Segen ist? Den Griechen, die am Wochenende in den Warteschlangen vor den Bancomaten standen, muss die Idee absurder vorgekommen sein als die Vorstellung, Wolfgang Schäuble werde jedem von ihnen persönlich aus seinem Portemonnaie über klamme Zeiten hinweghelfen. In Athen ist ein Vorrat an Geldscheinen und Münzen zu einer Überlebensversicherung geworden.Dabei ist es gar nicht lange her, dass der deutsche Wirtschaftsweise Peter Bofinger mit seinem Abschaffungsszenario internationales Echo auslöste. Er erklärte, Bargeld hemme nur den Zahlungsverkehr, fördere Steuerhinter\xadziehung und Schwarzarbeit. Euros, Dollars und Franken würden darum besser abgeschafft und durch elektronisches Bezahlen mit Kärtchen und Handys abgelöst.Damals, ein paar Wochen bevor Reisebüros ihren Kunden rieten, sich in den Ferien auf Mykonos lieber nicht auf Visa oder Mastercard zu verlassen, schien Bofingers Vorschlag zwar gewagt, aber eine Diskussion wert. Der Wirtschaftsweise war auch nicht der Erste, der die Idee ventilierte. Ernst zu nehmende Ökonomen wie Harvard-Professor Kenneth Rogoff, der ehemalige US-Finanzminister Lawrence Summers und Willem Buiter, der Chefökonom der Citigroup, haben schon ausführlich und eloquent über die Bargeldabschaffung nachgedacht. Eine Versammlung der Notenbanker in Basel diskutierte im Mai den Vorschlag.Banken fürchten Einkäufe am KioskWarum erhoffen sich Wissenschaftler, Noten- und andere Banker Vorteile vom ausnahmslos bargeldlosen Zahlungsverkehr? Sie nennen drei Gründe. Zentralbanker, die in ihrer Hilflosigkeit schon Negativzinsen eingeführt haben, um das An\xadhäufen von Geld unattraktiv zu machen, fürchten, dass Guthaben in Notenbündel umgeschichtet werden. Diesen kann die schleichende Enteignung durch Negativzinsen nichts anhaben. Die übrigen Banker erhoffen sich vom bargeldlosen Zahlungsverkehr mehr Profit aus Zahlungsverkehrsgebühren. Schliesslich ist jedes am Kiosk gegen Bargeld verkaufte Zigarettenpäckli für die Banken eine entgangene Gelegenheit, mitzu\xadkassieren. Und zu guter Letzt glauben Ökonomen wie Bofinger an eine Eindämmung von Drogenhandel, Überfällen und anderen illegalen Geschäften, die dunkle Gestalten im Schutz der Anonymität barer Münzen und Noten abwickeln.Der Beifall für Bofinger war enden wollend und die Kritik absehbar. In der Schweiz setzten sich «Blick» («Wir lassen uns unser Münz nicht wegnehmen!») und NZZ («Bargeld ist geprägte Freiheit») ins selbe Schnellboot publizistischer Empörung. Es mischt den Reflex gegen jede Bedrohung des Althergebrachten mit einem Liberalismus, der in der Anonymität, die das Bargeld bietet, eine Garantie für die Freiheit des Einzelnen sieht. Jedes Hunderternötli ein Freiheitsbrief, jeder Gedanke an seine Ab\xad\xadschaffung ein Angriff auf bürgerliche Rechte.Diese Sicht beruht auf einem Missverständnis: dass Bargeld, und nur Bargeld, Anonymität im Geldverkehr bieten kann. Die elektronische Zahlungsabwicklung legt, so glaubt man, immer eine Datenspur, die sich Banken, Staat oder?– noch schlimmer – Hacker für ihre kommerziellen, staatsschützerischen oder verbrecherischen Zwecke nutzen können.All das mag heute und in naher Zukunft noch zutreffen. Es wäre aber bar jeder Vernunft zu glauben, dass das so bleiben wird. Die Technik hat schon viele Bedürfnisse befriedigt. Sie wird auch das Grundbedürfnis nach anonymitäts\xadgeschützter Freiheit befriedigen können.Erste Vorboten sind schon zu erkennen. Möglich ist bereits heute die Ausgabe von Zahlkarten, die keine Rückschlüsse auf die Herkunft zulassen. Noch grössere Bedeutung kommt dem elektronischen Zahlsystem Bitcoin zu. Geschaffen haben es freiheitsliebende Programmierer der globalen Open-Source-\xadBewegung. Bitcoin ermöglicht anonyme Zahlungen auf der ganzen Welt. Ironischerweise liegt genau in diesem Umstand eine Hauptkritik an dem neuen Zahlungsmittel: Es lasse die Verschleierung finsterer Geschäfte zu. Was die einen an Banknoten und Münzen preisen, ist anderen an Bitcoin suspekt.Bargeld schafft sich selber abUnabhängig aller Abschaffungsdebatten steuert die technische Entwicklung ohnehin unaufhaltsam auf die Abschaffung des Bargelds zu. Die Banken preisen neue Zahlmethoden via Handy an. Dabei sind ihnen Technologiekonzerne wie Apple schon wieder einen Schritt voraus. Sie machen das Bezahlen mit der Armbanduhr möglich – was im Land der Uhren bald Nach\xadahmer finden wird.Die Geschichte des Fortschritts bleibt beim Bargeld also so wenig stehen wie in allen anderen Lebensbereichen. Aber akademische Debatten über die Abschaffung des Bargelds anzuzetteln, bewirkt genau das Gegenteil der guten Absicht: Sie lösen Angst- und Abwehrreflexe aus. Diese haben beim heutigen Stand der Technik (und des Eurozerfalls) vielleicht noch eine Berechtigung. Längerfristig aber ist es destruktiv, die Vorteile einer Welt ohne Bargeld durch die vorausseh\xadbaren Reflexe der Technikfeindlichkeit und eines fundamentalistischen Liberalismus verschleiern zu lassen.(Tages-Anzeiger)']","[""Matthew Roberts and Elías Snær Einarsson, two developers who have been active in the crypto space, recently proposed and published a new technology known as timechain.Simply put, the timechain is a chain of keys that can be used by anyone to encrypt any information for a certain period of time. It introduces proper incentives for the people who create and maintain the chain, hence the system is considered a decentralized autonomous company (DAC).The idea received quite some attention, as it claims to offer genuine security improvements for the crypto space. A lot of people have made attempts to use the element of time in cryptography, as it can solve many daily problems. Think of a trustless auction where people’s bids are revealed after a specific amount of time without relying on any third party.But how can we tie cryptography, the science of secrets, with time?Cryptography and TimeMachines, despite being fast compared to humans, require a processing time for completing actions. A more complicated process results in more computations by a machine, which obviously requires more time to be completed. One good example can be bitcoin mining, which requires roughly 10 minutes for miners to compute the puzzle and propose a block to the blockchain.So assuming we use a known input and generate an output using this complicated, long-running process like continuous hashing (Hashing is perfect since it’s a one way function and can’t be inverted) by machines and then use the generated output as an input in the science of cryptography, for example using the output as a cryptographic key to encrypt information.Once the encryption is completed, if we can get rid of the output that was generated earlier, we are only left with that known input, with which we started off. Decrypting that information can only be done with the output that we got rid of and the only way to generate that output now is to apply that long-running process again to the input.Therefore, now we can consider our information time-locked. The time that is required to unlock that information is the time needed to generate that output again. This is the basic concept time-locked encryption that was proposed in 1996 by Rivest and Shamir (two of the well-known cartographers of all time).Time-lock encryption has two steps. First step is to time-lock an input using a long-running process and the second step is to redo that process to achieve the same number again. The first step can be done using parallel processing concurrently to speed the process up whereas the second step can only be done in sequence to find the right output.So now the question is who’s going to perform this long running process?Maintaining the TimechainTimechain creates a process that anyone can participate in, just like mining, and generates a chain of locked numbers roughly every five minutes. The incentive for participant is a fee that is paid by those who want to use the service.CoinTelegraph asked Matthew Roberts about who initially maintains the timechain and what problems can it solve initially. He said:“To start with: we are. We're building the timechain to solve a very specific problem with smart contracts called transaction malleability. TX malleability effects refund protocols in smart contracts, and in order to fix them you have to rely on third parties to hold private keys. The timechain allows us to provide a refund service for our smart contracts (or anyone’s) which can't be hacked because of how the service is enforced.”But how do we make sure that those who create these outputs are throwing them away and not storing them? There is no guarantee that those who generate the output using hash functions will delete them. Roberts replied:“If the service in question wants to keep parts of the timechain around, they can, but it would defeat the security benefits of using a timechain and that wouldn't make much sense to spend so much money on computations and then not generate the timechain correctly. That's not to say that a single timechain should be trusted. In the ideal scenario, you would use your own timechain for things like wallets, and companies would each generate their own. But if you absolutely have to, you can always use a threshold scheme where information is encrypted with multiple timechains in such a way that a threshold can fail without being able to compromise the time-lock.”Roberts continued by mentioning a few other problems with the current paper. “There's a few more problems left with the timechain that will be fixed in v2 of the paper, like the double-spend problem with financial incentives and our messy blockchain idea,” he said. “Not big issues, just requires us to propagate rewards up the chain and gives the first person who gets to a reward the ability to hide it for around 10 minutes, so they have chance to claim it before another person arrives.”Ultimately timechain addresses a few security issues and tries to solve these problems by using time-lock encryption and creating a decentralized autonomous corporation with the right incentives for its maintainers to build these time-locked keys.While it still has a few technical challenges, it certainly holds a lot of promise and we need to wait to see the second paper describing their practical system before judging this technology."", ""Continuing the search for secure, cross-platform, end-to-end encrypted chat and VoIP communication software, this article is part 2 of a series on encrypted Skype alternatives.Skype, Microsoft's voice over IP (VoIP) software, has been shown to be insecure on various levels over the years. The Snowden leaks have revealed it to be more of a mass surveillance malware than a secure communications platform.Secure communications like those between you and a friend as you sip coffee in your backyard are the ideal of end-to-end (E2E) encrypted online communications.We want the same security, if not more, while talking to coworkers, friends or even strangers, from anywhere around the world. This is without a doubt a big challenge, especially when governments around the world are actively snooping and subtly trying to break into the mass communications of the general public.Snowden’s RecommendationsIf anyone ever needed to be certain that their communications were completely secure, it was Edward Snowden. He successfully retrieved a massive amount of top secret information from the the NSA, the publicly funded and supposedly accountable government agency. He then proceeded to blow the whistle by handing the information over to professional journalists. To do this, he had to use the best and most secure communications technology available, some of which he has since shared with the public.The first, is PGP.

Simon Derrick, currency strategist at BNY Mellon, says: “The risk is\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009that the Asian and European sessions are characterised by abrupt and substantial price moves.” Crucial for investors in Europe will be whether Greece will blow off course the eurozone’s gradual economic recovery. Some argue steps taken since 2011-12 have increased its resilience significantly. Erik Nielsen, chief economist at UniCredit, said in a note on Sunday: “I know that the safe bet is to predict disaster when you think through an unprecedented event, but I truly struggle to see why a Greek disaster should have more than limited and temporary effects on the rest of Europe. “My bottom line is this: if European risky assets sell off on the news of a Greek political suicide attempt, I’ll be a buyer on any material dip.” Currency Europe’s single currency has proved remarkably resilient to the drama in Greece so far. Whether this is because investors refuse to take the idea of a Greek exit seriously or believe the region is strong enough to withstand a default and ejection is not clear. Aurelija Augulyte, analyst at Nordea, says: “Many have been puzzled about [the euro] firming lately\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009making people believe [it] is a safe haven now. Is it, really? Probably not as safe at it seems — or not for long.” Formed in 1999, the euro enjoyed a decade of stability before the eurozone debt crisis began in 2010. Some contrarians believe the currency bloc will be stronger again without Greece. If so, the country’s ejection could even see the euro climbing again. Markets are at a critical juncture and significant euro weakness is highly likely, says Kit Juckes, analyst at Société Générale. “Risk aversion is likely to spread and despite the PBoC [People’s Bank of China] easing in China, we are likely to see a strong dollar, and a stronger yen, across the board in the next few days.” A yen for cherry blossoms and safety Play video Beat Siegenthaler, global macro adviser at UBS, says investors will weigh up whether the situation in Greece is a full-scale “risk-off” event or a bump in the road towards a global recovery. “Strong risk-off would probably boost dollar safe-haven demand despite US yields dropping,” Mr Siegenthaler says. “If seen just as a delay in normalisation then the dollar might go lower as investors temporarily close out of consensus positions.”', 'Bargeld ist ein Anachronismus, den abzuschaffen, ein Segen ist? Den Griechen, die am Wochenende in den Warteschlangen vor den Bancomaten standen, muss die Idee absurder vorgekommen sein als die Vorstellung, Wolfgang Schäuble werde jedem von ihnen persönlich aus seinem Portemonnaie über klamme Zeiten hinweghelfen. In Athen ist ein Vorrat an Geldscheinen und Münzen zu einer Überlebensversicherung geworden.Dabei ist es gar nicht lange her, dass der deutsche Wirtschaftsweise Peter Bofinger mit seinem Abschaffungsszenario internationales Echo auslöste. Er erklärte, Bargeld hemme nur den Zahlungsverkehr, fördere Steuerhinter\xadziehung und Schwarzarbeit. Euros, Dollars und Franken würden darum besser abgeschafft und durch elektronisches Bezahlen mit Kärtchen und Handys abgelöst.Damals, ein paar Wochen bevor Reisebüros ihren Kunden rieten, sich in den Ferien auf Mykonos lieber nicht auf Visa oder Mastercard zu verlassen, schien Bofingers Vorschlag zwar gewagt, aber eine Diskussion wert. Der Wirtschaftsweise war auch nicht der Erste, der die Idee ventilierte. Ernst zu nehmende Ökonomen wie Harvard-Professor Kenneth Rogoff, der ehemalige US-Finanzminister Lawrence Summers und Willem Buiter, der Chefökonom der Citigroup, haben schon ausführlich und eloquent über die Bargeldabschaffung nachgedacht. Eine Versammlung der Notenbanker in Basel diskutierte im Mai den Vorschlag.Banken fürchten Einkäufe am KioskWarum erhoffen sich Wissenschaftler, Noten- und andere Banker Vorteile vom ausnahmslos bargeldlosen Zahlungsverkehr? Sie nennen drei Gründe. Zentralbanker, die in ihrer Hilflosigkeit schon Negativzinsen eingeführt haben, um das An\xadhäufen von Geld unattraktiv zu machen, fürchten, dass Guthaben in Notenbündel umgeschichtet werden. Diesen kann die schleichende Enteignung durch Negativzinsen nichts anhaben. Die übrigen Banker erhoffen sich vom bargeldlosen Zahlungsverkehr mehr Profit aus Zahlungsverkehrsgebühren. Schliesslich ist jedes am Kiosk gegen Bargeld verkaufte Zigarettenpäckli für die Banken eine entgangene Gelegenheit, mitzu\xadkassieren. Und zu guter Letzt glauben Ökonomen wie Bofinger an eine Eindämmung von Drogenhandel, Überfällen und anderen illegalen Geschäften, die dunkle Gestalten im Schutz der Anonymität barer Münzen und Noten abwickeln.Der Beifall für Bofinger war enden wollend und die Kritik absehbar. In der Schweiz setzten sich «Blick» («Wir lassen uns unser Münz nicht wegnehmen!») und NZZ («Bargeld ist geprägte Freiheit») ins selbe Schnellboot publizistischer Empörung. Es mischt den Reflex gegen jede Bedrohung des Althergebrachten mit einem Liberalismus, der in der Anonymität, die das Bargeld bietet, eine Garantie für die Freiheit des Einzelnen sieht. Jedes Hunderternötli ein Freiheitsbrief, jeder Gedanke an seine Ab\xad\xadschaffung ein Angriff auf bürgerliche Rechte.Diese Sicht beruht auf einem Missverständnis: dass Bargeld, und nur Bargeld, Anonymität im Geldverkehr bieten kann. Die elektronische Zahlungsabwicklung legt, so glaubt man, immer eine Datenspur, die sich Banken, Staat oder?– noch schlimmer – Hacker für ihre kommerziellen, staatsschützerischen oder verbrecherischen Zwecke nutzen können.All das mag heute und in naher Zukunft noch zutreffen. Es wäre aber bar jeder Vernunft zu glauben, dass das so bleiben wird. Die Technik hat schon viele Bedürfnisse befriedigt. Sie wird auch das Grundbedürfnis nach anonymitäts\xadgeschützter Freiheit befriedigen können.Erste Vorboten sind schon zu erkennen. Möglich ist bereits heute die Ausgabe von Zahlkarten, die keine Rückschlüsse auf die Herkunft zulassen. Noch grössere Bedeutung kommt dem elektronischen Zahlsystem Bitcoin zu. Geschaffen haben es freiheitsliebende Programmierer der globalen Open-Source-\xadBewegung. Bitcoin ermöglicht anonyme Zahlungen auf der ganzen Welt. Ironischerweise liegt genau in diesem Umstand eine Hauptkritik an dem neuen Zahlungsmittel: Es lasse die Verschleierung finsterer Geschäfte zu. Was die einen an Banknoten und Münzen preisen, ist anderen an Bitcoin suspekt.Bargeld schafft sich selber abUnabhängig aller Abschaffungsdebatten steuert die technische Entwicklung ohnehin unaufhaltsam auf die Abschaffung des Bargelds zu. Die Banken preisen neue Zahlmethoden via Handy an. Dabei sind ihnen Technologiekonzerne wie Apple schon wieder einen Schritt voraus. Sie machen das Bezahlen mit der Armbanduhr möglich – was im Land der Uhren bald Nach\xadahmer finden wird.Die Geschichte des Fortschritts bleibt beim Bargeld also so wenig stehen wie in allen anderen Lebensbereichen. Aber akademische Debatten über die Abschaffung des Bargelds anzuzetteln, bewirkt genau das Gegenteil der guten Absicht: Sie lösen Angst- und Abwehrreflexe aus. Diese haben beim heutigen Stand der Technik (und des Eurozerfalls) vielleicht noch eine Berechtigung. Längerfristig aber ist es destruktiv, die Vorteile einer Welt ohne Bargeld durch die vorausseh\xadbaren Reflexe der Technikfeindlichkeit und eines fundamentalistischen Liberalismus verschleiern zu lassen.(Tages-Anzeiger)']"

08/08/2015,"['We all had to send money abroad and may be frustrated by either the transaction cost, the foreign exchange rate, or by the constraints of the amount being sent that shouldn’t be exceeded. Some may also question the safety of banks, especially as one can just look to Greece, where banks control the money of its clients by allowing them to take out a maximum of $60 per day, due to capital controls. Today, many people seek to no longer be tied to a financial system that make them dependent. They started using cryptocurrencies, and specifically Bitcoins that helped them control their own money, and send it abroad at no cost and with no limit. Cryptocurrencies were more interesting to them because they are not tied to any government. Thus, in case of crises, people are not affected. Some cryptocurrencies saw the light later but were not as successful as the Bitcoin, as they didn’t bring a lot of technical innovation.How can just a group of people create a new currency without being tied to any government and give this currency a value? The came question can be asked regarding how one dollar is worth one dollar? A group of people agreed on it to be priced at one dollar. Like for the dollar, a group of people agreed on the value of the Bitcoin. However, the Bitcoins have many downsides that were corrected by this new cryptocurrency that starts seeing the light: the GeoCoin.How does GeoCoin work?Every GeoCoin has a specific latitude and longitude on Earth. Every GeoCoin represents 11 square meters on the finite Earth surface. One can look for a GeoCoin after downloading an app called GeoCoin Snap, only available on Google Play at the moment, and will be launched on the App Store in August 2015. Once registered on the app, one is given a unique ID. A satellite is linked to the phone with its unique credentials and unique ID, and one can find a GeoCoin by being at a specific location and then snapping it. Snapping consists in sending a request to the satellite to acquire the GeoCoin. The satellite then checks if nobody before you has acquired this GeoCoin at the same latitude and longitude. If not, the GeoCoin is yours. It is linked to your unique identifier and unique coordinates through the app. Another way to acquire a GeoCoin is if someone gives it to you or if one exchanges it with traditional money.Due to the Earth’s finite surface, the value of the GeoCoin will appreciate. On the contrary of the Bitcoin, which requires solving complicated programs to acquire it, one doesn’t need to be a software programmer to find a GeoCoin. Thus, this new cryptocurrency came with a new feature. It is geo-context, meaning it is linked to a GPS or GIS Satellite. Therefore, the app can identify where one snapped the GeoCoin, and thus help in improving its security, avoiding the GeoCoin from being replicated at these same coordinates.Why does this new feature make the GeoCoin different from other cryptocurrencies?Because of the high volatility of the Bitcoin, many people are scared to use it. They don’t want their money to drop by 40% between the time they put it in their wallet and the time they are willing to buy goods. Thus, a currency needs to be stable to become effective, and the Bitcoin does not fulfill that role.According to Noah Smith, assistant professor of finance at Stony Brook University,“Fiat money is very stable in value during the short term, making it useful for buying things”The GeoCoin came to correct this flaw, having this fiat feature of money, and this is why it may attract more people than the Bitcoin. In fact, the GeoCoin has a reserve value, which means that it has a minimum value it should not go below, limiting the risks of volatility. Thus, it can create profit but reduces the loss if it happens. One knows that whichever may happen to the GeoCoin, he or she can still come out with the reserve value, feeling more secure about their money. Additionally, due to the geo-context, the GeoCoin can be tied to any fiat index, making it worthy. Contributing to its stability is its volume, that depends on the per capital GDP of the country where it is available, the GeoCoin is stable.The cost of mining a Bitcoin is higher than the cost of snapping a GeoCoin21 million Bitcoins were created, and they can be released through programs solving. Every four years, about half the remaining Bitcoins are given out. For the moment, a Bitcoin is released every 10 minutes. This means that by 2140, no further Bitcoin will be created. These programs are more and more complicated to solve, so as time goes by, it is more difficult and time consuming to release Bitcoins. However, the GeoCoin works more easily. Just like Bitcoins, GeoCoins are finite. Moreover, it is a greener alternative than the Bitcoin and its derivatives, as it uses satellites. In November 2014, the cost of electricity from mining a Bitcoin has hit the market price of the Bitcoin, and now it is no longer profitable to mine a Bitcoin, as the cost of mining is higher than the Bitcoin itself. For mining Bitcoins to be profitable, there should be sophisticated machines that are costly, and thus are not affordable by anyone. The GeoCoin is less costly as one will only need a smartphone to create the GeoCoin.To conclude, the GeoCoin is a soon-to-be stable currency and its Co-Founder, Enoch Cruz, is planning to tie it to the Euro and the Dollar. Thanks to its stability and simplicity to be found by anyone, the GeoCoin is secure and has all the features of money without being tied to any government.

You can connect online with people you know, as well people you don’t know, at no cost. Share personal opinions with the world through networks such as Twitter, and open lengthy discussions on topics you and your friends find interesting.In this day and age, it is important to build up a network of friends, colleagues, and people you love, as our society has grown estranged from each other. Even though none of us sees the people they care about as often as we would like, social media gives people around the world a powerful tool to stay in touch at any time.In recent years, however, it has become abundantly clear that social media never had noble intentions in terms of using personal data consumers willingly provide to these platforms. Advertisers get access to sensitive consumer information through these social media platforms in order to create targeted ad campaigns. Consumers do not get paid for their information, since they agree — whether they know it or not — to give it away for free to platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.Even social media platforms need to find creative ways to make money, and an IPO does not raise enough funds on a constant basis to keep things going. Advertising campaigns are just one of the many evil things social media platforms can do with consumer data, and it looks like Facebook wants to step up their game, albeit not in a positive manner.Companies can Send Unsolicited Messages to Individual Facebook UsersHanding over sensitive customer data for targeted advertisement campaigns is clearly not enough, as Facebook now allows companies to send private, unsolicited messages to individual users. Luckily for the recipients, they have the option of blocking further unwanted communication from these companies.Whenever an individual Facebook user writes on a company’s page, that company can then send a private message to that individual. While there is a clear use case for such a service in terms of support-related questions, it also opens up the door for spam, advertising, and who knows what else.The system also works the other way around: individual users can contact companies on Facebook and directly respond to advertisements. It is important to note that both companies and individual users can turn off this new Facebook feature on their profile pages. However, the feature rolled out without previous warning and went live just the other day.Even though this feature may seem to be a valuable addition to the Facebook ecosystem, it will be interesting to see how companies and individuals decide to use it. Advertising and spam are just a few clicks away on both ends, and it may not be long until this feature is disabled by most business and individuals to prevent that sort of behavior.Time for Decentralized Social Networks?Centralized social networks such as Facebook and Twitter take a more aggressive stance towards harvesting customer information. Although both platforms are easy to use and offer social benefits, users sacrifice a lot of privacy when using these social network. In a world where digital privacy is a topic of growing concern, the way social media gathers user data will have to change sooner or later.Blockchain technology can be adopted to create decentralized social networks, where users from all over the world can communicate with each other. There would be no centralized authority involved, as there is no physical network or data center. Every piece of information would be broadcast through a network of blockchain nodes, similar to how Bitcoin transactions work.The beautiful part of blockchain technology is the fact that is has been created for the individual users, by the individual users. There is nothing that can’t be achieved with blockchain technology, as layer upon layer of innovation is stacked upon each other. And all of this technology can be used with or without integrating Bitcoin as a payment method.Do social media platforms take data harvesting too far?

Advertising and spam are just a few clicks away on both ends, and it may not be long until this feature is disabled by most business and individuals to prevent that sort of behavior.Time for Decentralized Social Networks?Centralized social networks such as Facebook and Twitter take a more aggressive stance towards harvesting customer information. Although both platforms are easy to use and offer social benefits, users sacrifice a lot of privacy when using these social network. In a world where digital privacy is a topic of growing concern, the way social media gathers user data will have to change sooner or later.Blockchain technology can be adopted to create decentralized social networks, where users from all over the world can communicate with each other. There would be no centralized authority involved, as there is no physical network or data center. Every piece of information would be broadcast through a network of blockchain nodes, similar to how Bitcoin transactions work.The beautiful part of blockchain technology is the fact that is has been created for the individual users, by the individual users. There is nothing that can’t be achieved with blockchain technology, as layer upon layer of innovation is stacked upon each other. And all of this technology can be used with or without integrating Bitcoin as a payment method.Do social media platforms take data harvesting too far?

08/23/2015,"['When it announced its blockchain innovation lab earlier this year, UBS caused a ripple of excitement and trepidation.It was a watershed moment: one of the world’s wealthiest investment banks was putting its money, and public image, behind blockchain technology. Not only that, but it would be experimenting deep in the financial heart of London.The narrative around bitcoin has shifted since the cryptocurrency first gained notoriety via illegal activities and anti-bank sentiment. The finance world is now racing to test it – and other blockchain technologies – out in startups, research projects and in-house R&D teams.Alex Batlin, the former engineer heading up the lab, told CoinDesk that while financial technologies like peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding platforms are on the rise, it\'s blockchain technology that could be the biggest threat or opportunity for banks like UBS.""In principle it\'s probably one of the biggest confluences of technology and business right now.""His mission over the next year is to figure out how best to ""future proof"" the bank and find a way for shareholders to profit from these rapid changes.The ROI problemBatlin describes the bank\'s innovation process as ""robust"", with business and technology departments engaging in a two-way conversation about potential threats and opportunities as they surface.Typically, UBS will be able to assess the return on investment (ROI) for a new idea before it makes a commitment to explore it further. However, as blockchain technology is so new, and changing rapidly, the bank’s usual strategy has gone out the window.""In this case to create the ROI, you have to spend so much money ... you need an ROI of an ROI,"" Batlin said.For him, it\'s a chicken-and-egg situation – and one that UBS has a shot at cracking. It has assembled what he terms a ""small, agile team"" consisting of developers, business analysts and project managers inside Europe\'s biggest FinTech accelerator, Level39.In \'back of the envelope\' style, these members will sit together to work out if a business model could be improved or redefined by blockchain technology – and if its benefits outweigh the potential costs.Really, the lab is a year-long experiment for UBS to reduce the unknowns around blockchain technology, of which there are many.""We believe it\'s the best combination of making sure we don’t spend too much but also getting the most out of our learnings from that,"" he said.Batlin says a lot of the team’s time is spent brainstorming and sketching out ideas in meeting rooms, coming up with whacky new business models and then testing them.""We conduct experiments, which are different to proof-of-concepts, as we don\'t have a concept yet. We’re just saying, here\'s a hypothesis, let\'s figure out could it work at all,"" he continued.Most of the projects UBS is building won\'t look anything like working solutions just yet.""The technology is so nascent, it\'s important to have the right set of expectations,"" he added.InteroperabilityBack in March 2014, UBS wrote at length about how banks could co-opt bitcoin for traditional functions. Its undesired \'quirks\' could be removed, while benefits could be absorbed to reduce duplication and bottlenecks in the current financial system, the report read.Since then, a wave of new companies – alongside some existing bitcoin firms – have announced custom ledger systems that adapt blockchain technology for the world’s financial institutions.As the space is highly intermediated, Batlin admits there is potential for a system that can remove complexity from the market and reduce the costs of participation. However, with multiple blockchain systems vying for market share, he warned that companies could be replacing one problem with another – reduced interoperability.""If you are participating in over 100 blockchain networks, all you are doing is swapping one set of complicated technology for another.""Rather than multiple closed systems, similar to MSN and AOL, for him, the real cost savings come with a common standard, like the Internet, which he describes as a ""multi-asset chain where I can trade securities, derivatives, cash all in the same platform"".While there are risks pegging financial services to one set of standards, there are precedents in recent history that support the idea that common standards can support this amount of risk, he said.Though banks are not famed for collaboration, reports indicate there is some cross-market cooperation or coordination happening already. Batlin agrees that this is crucial for the technology to flourish, and for banks to get the most from it:""This is a cross-market initiative. There is no point having a private road where you only drive in a circle on your own.""London callingThe UK – and London – are fast becoming a hub for companies at the intersection of finance and tech. The country accounted for 42% of Europe\'s FinTech investment last year, while the sector employs more than 135,000 people, many of which are in the capital.Besides its mature FinTech ecosystem, London was an attractive home for the Swiss bank\'s project due to the UK government\'s open-minded stance on cryptocurrency regulation.Level39\'s hub in Canary Wharf is close to Innovate Finance, the FinTech trade association with strong ties to government, and the FCA is just across the road. The Bank of England is also known to be a regular visitor.""It\'s easy for people to come and meet here. You are not asking for people to come to UBS, you are asking for people to come to Level39,"" Batlin said. Alongside CIO Oliver Bussmann, he is a regular mentor to fledgling startups at Level39, including blockchain-based platform Tide Payments.While some startups and VCs in the ecosystem, including Index\'s Ophelia Brown, have berated banks for denying bitcoin startups bank accounts and quelling innovation in the process, Batlin sees it differently.""We have thousands of clients, globally, who depend on us to provide them with the advice, expertise and opportunities they need to protect and grow their wealth, so we naturally have to be a little more cautious and it would be irresponsible for us to take the risks they [startups] do.""Batlin went on to say that some problems could be too expensive for startups to solve.""A team of 12 can accomplish brilliant things, for sure. But some challenges require a level of resource to overcome, which the likes of UBS can contribute and become a valuable partner in this new world,"" he said, concluding:""I think the partnership between bigger companies and startups can work really well because we can complement each other.""The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

E-coin ships to 173 countries, and the cards can be used in any country. Since the E-coin debit card works like a VISA card, support for it has already been built in, with over 30 million ATMs and 25 million merchants accepting VISA worldwide.“For a currency to gain adoption it needs to circulate. Although already quite popular, bitcoin is still not very easy to get and spend for an average Joe. Our bitcoin debit card does not solve the whole problem, but it does solve half of it – it makes spending bitcoin as easy as spending dollars or euros, or any other traditional currency. This is one step towards wider adoption of the cryptocurrency.”E-coin strives to make its product stand out from the sea of bitcoin debit cards currently on the market. While E-coin is already a preferred Bitcoin debit card service, the company still wants to take it a step further:“We offer instant loading, good exchange rate, multi-signature protection of users’ wallets and quick and responsive customer service. Based on what we hear from clients, forums, etc. that is the combination of these factors makes our service stand out.”E-coin Affiliate Program LaunchedE-coin is now introducing an affiliate program to all card holders. The program is structured where affiliates will earn 10% of gross fees on their referrals in the first year, and 5% for every year after that; the referrer will be able to earn bitcoins from every card load transaction made forever.Consumers who sign up from a personalized link will also benefit from a 25% discount when ordering their cards, making the rewards a two-way street. All referrals and commissions are earned in real time and can be seen from your account page to quickly track who you are earning Bitcoin from.Do you use Bitcoin debit cards? Does the E-coin affiliate program entice you enough to swap cards? Let us know in the comments below!Photo Sources: E-coinFor more information: E-coin’s WebsiteOriginally posted on: E-Coin Launches Bitcoin Debit Card Affiliate Program', 'Users of Circle Inc., the Boston-based bitcoin startup, have been disputing with the company regarding payment verifications and banning of bank accounts. According to its users, Circle has started to hold payments for several days and ban accounts, in the tradition of Paypal.Circle states on its website that it “believes that sending and receiving money should be […] instant and free.” Ironically, the startup has made it incredibly difficult to send payments and is creating a centralized payment infrastructure on top of the bitcoin, which negates the decentralized benefit of the cryptocurrency.In accordance with Circle’s long list of policies that specifies the need for payment verifications and the banning of Circle accounts that engage in “illegal” purchases, the company has begun banning bank accounts and freezing payments for days for additional verification.One merchant found out the hard way when one of her customers used a Circle wallet to purchase products on the merchant’s e-commerce store, Hairlosstalk. The website suggested its users to purchase bitcoin using Circle, because it allows users to connect their bank accounts and buy bitcoins with USD.One user emailed Stacia, the owner of the Hairlosstalk, saying that banks had banned bitcoin purchases and therefore limited the user’s access to Circle. However, Stacia found that Circle banned the user’s bank accounts and credit cards and restricted the user from purchasing bitcoins.Stacia said:Clearly he thinks his bank and credit cards have banned Bitcoin, but what happened is that Circle banned his bank accounts and credit cards. I thought the entire point of Circle was instant wallet funding via credit cards? I feel pretty embarrassed right now to be honest. Circle recently raised over US$50 million in funding, with support from Goldman Sachs and IDG Capital Partners of China. The bitcoin wallet and exchange allows users to deposit dollars and bitcoins and send it to anyone around the world “for free.” However, recent events, user experiences and new policies suggest that Circle is shifting to a more traditional financial platform, more like a bank than a bitcoin exchange.In a few months, Circle’s vision for its bitcoin platform went from “instant” to a few days and, quite possibly, a couple of weeks and months.Users have begun to complain about Circle’s verification system and to leave the bitcoin platform for others. One user named Michael wrote on Uncrunched in February:”I created an account and tried to add my bank account and credit card to deposit money into the system (as Bitcoin). I had to give a lot of personal information. And I had to take a photo of my drivers license. I don’t have a huge problem with that since these kinds of services are a huge fraud magnet. But Circle said they needed time to review the information. and here’s the problem, they basically (kind of) shut down my account while they were doing that.”More than 10 public complaints have been uploaded on Reddit since the funding in 2014. Many users complained saying “i linked my debit card, made a purchase, it gets cancelled. i wait two days to link my bank account, make a small 10$ purchase, still no bitcoins. isnt it supposed to be instant?” and “After waiting a few days for my free $10 promotion to appear, I contacted Circle support and was told they stopped honoring that promotion”Disclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Alongside CIO Oliver Bussmann, he is a regular mentor to fledgling startups at Level39, including blockchain-based platform Tide Payments.While some startups and VCs in the ecosystem, including Index\'s Ophelia Brown, have berated banks for denying bitcoin startups bank accounts and quelling innovation in the process, Batlin sees it differently.""We have thousands of clients, globally, who depend on us to provide them with the advice, expertise and opportunities they need to protect and grow their wealth, so we naturally have to be a little more cautious and it would be irresponsible for us to take the risks they [startups] do.""Batlin went on to say that some problems could be too expensive for startups to solve.""A team of 12 can accomplish brilliant things, for sure. But some challenges require a level of resource to overcome, which the likes of UBS can contribute and become a valuable partner in this new world,"" he said, concluding:""I think the partnership between bigger companies and startups can work really well because we can complement each other.""The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

E-coin ships to 173 countries, and the cards can be used in any country. Since the E-coin debit card works like a VISA card, support for it has already been built in, with over 30 million ATMs and 25 million merchants accepting VISA worldwide.“For a currency to gain adoption it needs to circulate. Although already quite popular, bitcoin is still not very easy to get and spend for an average Joe. Our bitcoin debit card does not solve the whole problem, but it does solve half of it – it makes spending bitcoin as easy as spending dollars or euros, or any other traditional currency. This is one step towards wider adoption of the cryptocurrency.”E-coin strives to make its product stand out from the sea of bitcoin debit cards currently on the market. While E-coin is already a preferred Bitcoin debit card service, the company still wants to take it a step further:“We offer instant loading, good exchange rate, multi-signature protection of users’ wallets and quick and responsive customer service. Based on what we hear from clients, forums, etc. that is the combination of these factors makes our service stand out.”E-coin Affiliate Program LaunchedE-coin is now introducing an affiliate program to all card holders. The program is structured where affiliates will earn 10% of gross fees on their referrals in the first year, and 5% for every year after that; the referrer will be able to earn bitcoins from every card load transaction made forever.Consumers who sign up from a personalized link will also benefit from a 25% discount when ordering their cards, making the rewards a two-way street. All referrals and commissions are earned in real time and can be seen from your account page to quickly track who you are earning Bitcoin from.Do you use Bitcoin debit cards? Does the E-coin affiliate program entice you enough to swap cards? Let us know in the comments below!Photo Sources: E-coinFor more information: E-coin’s WebsiteOriginally posted on: E-Coin Launches Bitcoin Debit Card Affiliate Program', 'Users of Circle Inc., the Boston-based bitcoin startup, have been disputing with the company regarding payment verifications and banning of bank accounts. According to its users, Circle has started to hold payments for several days and ban accounts, in the tradition of Paypal.Circle states on its website that it “believes that sending and receiving money should be […] instant and free.” Ironically, the startup has made it incredibly difficult to send payments and is creating a centralized payment infrastructure on top of the bitcoin, which negates the decentralized benefit of the cryptocurrency.In accordance with Circle’s long list of policies that specifies the need for payment verifications and the banning of Circle accounts that engage in “illegal” purchases, the company has begun banning bank accounts and freezing payments for days for additional verification.One merchant found out the hard way when one of her customers used a Circle wallet to purchase products on the merchant’s e-commerce store, Hairlosstalk. The website suggested its users to purchase bitcoin using Circle, because it allows users to connect their bank accounts and buy bitcoins with USD.One user emailed Stacia, the owner of the Hairlosstalk, saying that banks had banned bitcoin purchases and therefore limited the user’s access to Circle. However, Stacia found that Circle banned the user’s bank accounts and credit cards and restricted the user from purchasing bitcoins.Stacia said:Clearly he thinks his bank and credit cards have banned Bitcoin, but what happened is that Circle banned his bank accounts and credit cards. I thought the entire point of Circle was instant wallet funding via credit cards? I feel pretty embarrassed right now to be honest. Circle recently raised over US$50 million in funding, with support from Goldman Sachs and IDG Capital Partners of China. The bitcoin wallet and exchange allows users to deposit dollars and bitcoins and send it to anyone around the world “for free.” However, recent events, user experiences and new policies suggest that Circle is shifting to a more traditional financial platform, more like a bank than a bitcoin exchange.In a few months, Circle’s vision for its bitcoin platform went from “instant” to a few days and, quite possibly, a couple of weeks and months.Users have begun to complain about Circle’s verification system and to leave the bitcoin platform for others. One user named Michael wrote on Uncrunched in February:”I created an account and tried to add my bank account and credit card to deposit money into the system (as Bitcoin). I had to give a lot of personal information. And I had to take a photo of my drivers license. I don’t have a huge problem with that since these kinds of services are a huge fraud magnet. But Circle said they needed time to review the information. and here’s the problem, they basically (kind of) shut down my account while they were doing that.”More than 10 public complaints have been uploaded on Reddit since the funding in 2014. Many users complained saying “i linked my debit card, made a purchase, it gets cancelled. i wait two days to link my bank account, make a small 10$ purchase, still no bitcoins. isnt it supposed to be instant?” and “After waiting a few days for my free $10 promotion to appear, I contacted Circle support and was told they stopped honoring that promotion”Disclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

09/13/2015,"['After receiving US$13.7m in previous funding rounds, the San Francisco-based startup Chain Inc. announced on Thursday that it has raised another US$30m in equity funding, and this time from some of the biggest names in the financial sector, including Visa, Nasdaq, Citi Ventures, CapitalOne, Fiserv and French telecom Orange.- Adam Ludwin, Chain CEOThe Chain platform was created to enable banks and financial institutions to create, issue, store and transfer digital assets on private networks purpose-built for a given market. These networks typically will not use bitcoin as a currency but are based on the bitcoin blockchain and protocol, and can also be interoperable with other open digital currency networks, including other Chain clients.- LudwinChain is also considering the use of sidechains, or other blockchains that connect to the Bitcoin public blockchain to share its\' value while being tailored to specific uses or industries. “Ultimately, this question of the public Bitcoin blockchain versus a private permissioned ledger is somewhat like VHS versus Betamax,” Ludwin has stated.While at first it may sound unlikely for legacy banks and payment networks to fund their own disruption, Blockchains will be much cheaper for everyone to use than older financial instruments like credit cards. The banks, Visa, MasterCard, and American Express all collect 1% to 3% of domestic credit and debit transactions, generating more than $70 billion a year in fees in the U.S. market alone. “That’s a tax on all payments,” Wedbush analyst Luria told Forbes. “With Bitcoin that goes practically to zero.”“The days of [banks] holding onto people’s money a little bit longer and benefiting from that, or charging people fees and high margins on exchange rates, are going to end,” predicts Susan Athey, Board member at Ripple Labs and professor of the economics of technology at Stanford’s business school.Eric Piscini, a principal in banking tech at Deloitte, gives a slightly different view of this, citing intentional auto-deconstruction. “The big financial companies need to be involved early to identify where blockchain will eat their profits, and then they must decide, ‘Should I cannibalize myself instead of waiting for someone else to cannibalize me?’”- LudwinChain launched with 15 employees and three founders in 2014, immediately working with banks and other leading institutions. US$43.7m in backing and a list of investors packed with big banks and financial institutions puts Chain on the forefront of Bitcoin-finance industry relations, but there is competition in the sector.ItBit, the first bitcoin exchange to open on Wall Street, announced an upcoming product it calls Bankchain. Rather than using the public Bitcoin blockchain, it will use its\' own permissioned ledger to do many of the same functions that Chain does, so it has yet to be seen if this business model is a threat to Chain.San Francisco-based Ripple Labs also uses its own protocol and permissioned, distributed ledger that is not an actual blockchain. Their different internal structure may be of competition to Chain for the purpose of Forex and perhaps internal settlements.Former JP Morgan executive Blythe Masters\' Digital Asset Holdings appears to be more in competition with Chain than the rest, have aquired permissioned ledger company HyperLedger. The company recently announced that a portion of it’s latest US$5m funding round has been issued utilizing distributed ledger technology.Despite plenty of competition, It\'s not much of a mystery why Chain is the company that so many financial behemoths are reaching out to in the Blockchain space. Chain made some key deals early on.In June, Nasdaq announced that it has chosen Chain as a technology partner for its Private Market. As Ludwin recently told Nasdaq.com in an interview, “We believe in the power of blockchain technology to transform how financial assets are transferred, but it has to be done with the right partners to ensure it gets off the ground.”- Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq CEOWith a plan to go fully live in November, Nasdaq will offer blockchain-based trading for shares of pre-IPO private companies, including Uber and Airbnb. Greifeld hinted about the many opportunities using the blockchain, saying “[Blockchain] is the biggest opportunity set we can think of over the next decade or so.”""Chain is collaborating closely with us to increase efficiency in the capital markets,"" said Brad Peterson, Chief Information Officer, Nasdaq. ""We see their platform helping us accelerate our time-to-market across our various blockchain initiatives. We are excited to further our partnership with them through Nasdaq\'s investment in the company.""Popular gift card service Gyft, with its 300 big-box retailers and restaurant chains, announced that it is using Chain as well. CEO Vinny Lingham says that it offers Gyft a cheaper, more secure solution that will allow Gyft to sign up thousands of small merchants, alongside it’s current larger merchants today.- Vinny Lingham, Gyft CEOAnother backer is French telecom company Orange, which suggested it might be looking at a way to integrate the technology into its mobile offerings. ""We believe in the disruptive potential of the blockchain. Becoming a key partner and investor in Chain will help us to learn faster and perform tests around this technology,"" said Orange\'s Deputy CEO Pierre Louette.- Pierre Louette Orange Deputy CEOGlobal payments, processing, and risk management mainstay Fiserv is another investor that saw an opportunity in Chain. ""Blockchain technology presents a new opportunity to enhance the financial services experience,"" stated Fiserv CEO, Jeff Yabuki.- Jeff Yabuki, Fiserv CEOCredit giant Capital One\'s venture capital arm couldn\'t resist backing Ludwin and his team as well. ""Chain provides a developer-centric technology platform that is as intuitive as it is powerful,"" stated Adam Boutin of Capital One Ventures.- Adam Boutin, CapitalOne VenturesVisa also partnered with Chain. Jim McCarthy, the executive Vice President of innovation and strategic partnerships at Visa said that ""Visa\'s investment in Chain underscores our long-standing commitment to explore technology, like the blockchain, that could have the potential to advance secure and convenient digital payments for our clients and their customers.”He went on to categorize this investment as “an extension of the work that the company has done with other technology partners such as Apple, Google, Samsung, Stripe and Square.”Approaching new markets is another reason Visa is interested in Chain. “Business-to-business spending or business-to-government spending is a much larger pie where we have very little penetration,” McCarthy continued, “and that might lend itself to an area where it can leverage the blockchain.”Citi, the largest bank grabbing a slice of the Chain pie, seems to be getting involved to test out the blockchain across a whole range of innovations. ""Blockchain technology represents a fundamental, generational shift for financial services, and Chain\'s platform is enabling and accelerating this transformation,"" stated Ramneek Gupta, Managing Director of Global Venture Investing at Citi Ventures.- Ramneek Gupta, Citi VenturesAll of Chain\'s investors will be meeting twice a year in what has been named the “Blockchain Working Group.” Meetings will be composed of the latest developments in distributed ledger technology, and each company will have the opportunity to present to each other and also get updates directly from a Chain officer, since the companies themselves will not be joining its board.', 'Discussing cryptocurrency with people who don’t know anything about virtual money can become rather difficult. The task is often hard because the basic concept of money itself is not visualized. I would say the best thing to do in this situation is to ask the following: do you understand the money in your own pocket?Typically the answer is “well no”, which is somewhat amusing. However, this lack of knowledge regarding the money we use every day is a sign that this subject was never properly taught.This information was never shared in schools for a reason: because understanding the basic concepts of your money and economy is sovereign power. The concept of Bitcoin is hard to conceptualize when you don’t know about the very basics of your own money.[tweet_box design=”box_02?]Understanding Bitcoin is a hard task. But do you understand the money in your own pocket?[/tweet_box]Quantitative easingFiat money or paper dollars are inflationary. They can be represented in bills or online digits in bank accounts, and are produced centrally by the central banking system.These private banking institutions create legal tender for citizens to use in their monetary transactions on a day to day basis. The money is printed with no transparency. Experts have said that billions of dollars are printed every month, or created in the wild world. Fiat money relies on central banking, which is sponsored by the governance in a geographical region. This in turn creates a monopoly on the tender we use everyday, and creates harsh boom and bust cycles in our economy.“The printing of vast amounts of fiat has created giant subsidies of fractional banking on the human system.”Governments have allowed the monetary exchange economy to lean on destroying itself and depreciate in time coincidently with people having little understanding of the printing game itself.Dollar or fiat money is not at all legitimate money when compared to precious metal coin or Bitcoins. The eight percent of hard cash or digits are, in fact, what’s called promissory notes. Where the maker or an issuer promises to pay or make the funds “real”. But the only way they can make these billions of pieces of paper “real” is by ensuring they will be accepted. That’s where governments and law settle: in the fact that they “must” be accepted.However, this is only true to what they say and what they print is nothingness and false promises. Inflation may be the biggest robbery on mankind and understanding it is a must.Proof of work producesWIth Bitcoin there is only 21 million cryptographically-insured units. A ton of them are lost and the blocks being found by miners are becoming increasingly harder to find. Until one day the very last Satoshi will be found in 2140, and then the units will be fully distributed.These coins can never be mass printed or counterfeited as they are validated through proof of work. Unlike the federal reserve, which prints by its own measure. The Bitcoin protocol is the first of its class in technology that can someday allow global consensus without the need for a central third party. This currency is the perfect money because it operates fluidly with the community who understand its three foundations: open source, decentralized and peer-to-peer. These core pillars representing the crypto-world have the power to change every financial sector, making it inclusive for every individual.Bitcoin has the monumental power of filtering its protocol into more than just currency. Which will create a flourishing economy for every person on this planet. The Bitcoin protocol can create decentralized businesses, crowd fund, transparent voting processes, identity and reputation systems and so much more.Take these things and they create thousands, if not millions, of emerging jobs. It’s estimated that half the adults in the world do not have access to banking. However, many of these people try to participate in e-commerce, but lack the necessary financial tools to trade with. Bitcoin is all inclusive to every single one of these people and operates 24 hours a day. The system allows instantaneous transferring of funds in a peer-to-peer environment with absolutely no third party.Open source, decentralized, peer-to-peerBitcoin can be understood by its deflation rate and shows by example that deflationary spirals are a myth. With a predetermined trajectory that cannot be manipulated by the Fed, the Bitcoin protocol and currency offer us the lasting control over our wealth.Today’s fiat scheme is destroying our economy and societal infrastructure. By vacating this destructive monopoly we can use a new means of voluntary and universal exchange. One that is founded upon three core ideologies of the free market, which will someday give the means of production back to its individual nodes.Fiat money is printed exponentially and by whim. It’s accepted because the governments are behind it: but it devalue its uses every single waking moment. The idea is not to let our children pay $40 dollars for a loaf of bread, but to break the precedent of busts and hyperinflation. Bitcoin has the means to do that, and the ends are all inclusive for every single person on this planet. The existence of this protocol alone shows the true power of ‘human action’ and should whitewash corruption with a new color of transparency.When you understand the concept of what your money does you can then proceed to spend your wealth wisely. You can say “yes, I know the basic of inflationary and deflationary concepts.” Most people learning the basics about this beast often want to learn more so they can avoid the corruption and pillaging of their assets. With this said, there is a great responsibility in understanding the basic origins of how money is produced. Whether it’s central or decentralized, knowing is half the battle.', 'El uso de Bitcoin evita los problemas y molestias referentes al manejo de la moneda tradicional y los problemas cambiarios.

This step is a big one, as the S7 is shipping to anyone around the worl — from small home miners to large data centers. Many other manufacturers are only using in-house or for the certain large mining operations that have announced new chips. Recently, we interviewed Jihan Wu co-founder of Bitmain. After the interview, Jihan sent a Bitmain Antminer S7 to review. The miner is an excellent step up from current offerings on the market. Let’s look at the specifications.Also Read: Exclusive Interview With Jihan Wu of Bitmain on S7, Block Size Debate and MoreAntminer S7 Specifications:Hash Rate: 4.86 TH/sPower Consumption: 1210 W (at the wall, with APW3, 93% efficiency, 25C ambient temp)Power Efficiency: 0.25 J/GH (at the wall, with APW3, 93% efficiency, 25°C ambient temp)Rated Voltage: 12.0V+5%, should not be less than 12.0VChips per unit: 162x BM1385Dimensions: 301mm(L)*123mm(W)*155mm(H)Cooling: 2x 120mm fanWeight: 4kgOperating Temperature: 0 °C to 40 °CNetwork Connection: EthernetDisclosure: Antminer S7 was provided by Bitmain for review.The S7 arrived fast and with no damage. The Antminer S7 is built solidly with a dual push-pull fan system. The S7 is roughly the same size as the S5 and packs a lot of power in a small package. The housing has a new twist to it, in that you can connect 3 of them together at the sides with a tongue and groove system. I say three of them, as each controller has the connections to run three S7s at the same time. This stacking option will allow for several different ways to deploy them. We were unable to test how many at a time the controller will run as at this time we only have the one S7. Being able to stack them together even if you are not using one controller for multiple units is a plus. It can make for more secure arrangements in your racks and shelving.Antminer S7, Powerful Hashing With Lower Power ConsumptionThe power consumption to th/s ratio of the S7 shines. While the S5 produced 1.155 th/s at 600 watts, the Antminer S7 is producing 4.9 th/s using 1250 watts with a stock freq of 600. For this review, we used two EVGA Supernova 1300 watt Gold rated PSUs. We will be doing a video demo of the unit with the Bitmain 1600 watt PSU shortly.The power connection setup is a bit different than you are used to seeing on Antminers. The beefier controller requires a PCIe connection to feed it power. Each hashing board requires all three plugs connected and uses roughly 405 watts. What we did for this review was connect two of them to one PSU. Then connected the 3rd board and the controller to the other PSU. It is important to remember only to connect one PSU to a hashing board. Do not mix multiple PSUs on the same board. Also of note is to power on the PSU that does not power the controller first. This arrangement will mean the hashing boards are powering up first for the controller to detect when you power on that PSU last.When the Antminer S7 is running, the noise is less than expected for a dual fan unit that is having to dissipate the heat generated in such a small package. Bitmain did a good of pairing fans that are high CFM yet not screaming loud. The S7 is louder than the S5, but not as loud as the S5+. At 4 feet, it registers 66 dB. Most of the noise sounds like rushing air. There is no high pitched whine. While this may not be something you want to put in your living room, but it won’t drive you out of your garage either.0.25 J/GH on a 28nm DieBitmain’s simple to use software is on the controller with the current firmware version being dated August 29th. We did not find any bugs or glitches as we sometimes find that some miners have when we get them before the general public. The freq selection is set up simply and offers lots of options, so overclocking and downclocking is simple to do.The BM1385 ASIC is built using the 28nm process. In conversations with Jihan, he has stated that the 28nm process can be further optimized and with 28nm being a mature tech chips can be produced faster and cheaper while providing gains in performance. This performance gain is very obvious with the BM1385 ASIC as the power to gh/s ratio at 0.25 J/GH is very aggressive. The larger die size allows for a greater surface for heat dissipation as well. These things add up to an S7 that has a small form factor and solid performance.The Antminer S7 is a solid performing Bitcoin ASIC miner that is being sold to anyone. The familiar form factor that Bitmain debuted with the S1 is there. Adding the tweaks of the tongue and groove system on the chassis allowing for easier stacking coupled with a robust controller allow for new options for deployment. The performance is the best on the market right now that you can get your hands on for Bitcoin ASIC miners. Bitmain has stated they will begin shipping the last week of Sept to the first week or so of Oct for batch one. From how the unit we received for review works they have the process down and things look good for their shipping window.The Antminer S7 is a solid miner that will fit in well from small to large installations. The ease of use that is one of Bitmain’s hallmarks is there as well. The S7 on stock setting is putting out a reliable 4.9 th/s across Antpool, and Kano.is while pulling 1250 watts. It is a top performer like the S5 before it. The Bitcoin block reward halving will be happening at the end of July 2016 so getting your hands on the most efficient miners you can right now is crucial. The S7 is a great option.What are your thoughts on the Antminer S7?

Which will create a flourishing economy for every person on this planet. The Bitcoin protocol can create decentralized businesses, crowd fund, transparent voting processes, identity and reputation systems and so much more.Take these things and they create thousands, if not millions, of emerging jobs. It’s estimated that half the adults in the world do not have access to banking. However, many of these people try to participate in e-commerce, but lack the necessary financial tools to trade with. Bitcoin is all inclusive to every single one of these people and operates 24 hours a day. The system allows instantaneous transferring of funds in a peer-to-peer environment with absolutely no third party.Open source, decentralized, peer-to-peerBitcoin can be understood by its deflation rate and shows by example that deflationary spirals are a myth. With a predetermined trajectory that cannot be manipulated by the Fed, the Bitcoin protocol and currency offer us the lasting control over our wealth.Today’s fiat scheme is destroying our economy and societal infrastructure. By vacating this destructive monopoly we can use a new means of voluntary and universal exchange. One that is founded upon three core ideologies of the free market, which will someday give the means of production back to its individual nodes.Fiat money is printed exponentially and by whim. It’s accepted because the governments are behind it: but it devalue its uses every single waking moment. The idea is not to let our children pay $40 dollars for a loaf of bread, but to break the precedent of busts and hyperinflation. Bitcoin has the means to do that, and the ends are all inclusive for every single person on this planet. The existence of this protocol alone shows the true power of ‘human action’ and should whitewash corruption with a new color of transparency.When you understand the concept of what your money does you can then proceed to spend your wealth wisely. You can say “yes, I know the basic of inflationary and deflationary concepts.” Most people learning the basics about this beast often want to learn more so they can avoid the corruption and pillaging of their assets. With this said, there is a great responsibility in understanding the basic origins of how money is produced. Whether it’s central or decentralized, knowing is half the battle.', 'El uso de Bitcoin evita los problemas y molestias referentes al manejo de la moneda tradicional y los problemas cambiarios.

This step is a big one, as the S7 is shipping to anyone around the worl — from small home miners to large data centers. Many other manufacturers are only using in-house or for the certain large mining operations that have announced new chips. Recently, we interviewed Jihan Wu co-founder of Bitmain. After the interview, Jihan sent a Bitmain Antminer S7 to review. The miner is an excellent step up from current offerings on the market. Let’s look at the specifications.Also Read: Exclusive Interview With Jihan Wu of Bitmain on S7, Block Size Debate and MoreAntminer S7 Specifications:Hash Rate: 4.86 TH/sPower Consumption: 1210 W (at the wall, with APW3, 93% efficiency, 25C ambient temp)Power Efficiency: 0.25 J/GH (at the wall, with APW3, 93% efficiency, 25°C ambient temp)Rated Voltage: 12.0V+5%, should not be less than 12.0VChips per unit: 162x BM1385Dimensions: 301mm(L)*123mm(W)*155mm(H)Cooling: 2x 120mm fanWeight: 4kgOperating Temperature: 0 °C to 40 °CNetwork Connection: EthernetDisclosure: Antminer S7 was provided by Bitmain for review.The S7 arrived fast and with no damage. The Antminer S7 is built solidly with a dual push-pull fan system. The S7 is roughly the same size as the S5 and packs a lot of power in a small package. The housing has a new twist to it, in that you can connect 3 of them together at the sides with a tongue and groove system. I say three of them, as each controller has the connections to run three S7s at the same time. This stacking option will allow for several different ways to deploy them. We were unable to test how many at a time the controller will run as at this time we only have the one S7. Being able to stack them together even if you are not using one controller for multiple units is a plus. It can make for more secure arrangements in your racks and shelving.Antminer S7, Powerful Hashing With Lower Power ConsumptionThe power consumption to th/s ratio of the S7 shines. While the S5 produced 1.155 th/s at 600 watts, the Antminer S7 is producing 4.9 th/s using 1250 watts with a stock freq of 600. For this review, we used two EVGA Supernova 1300 watt Gold rated PSUs. We will be doing a video demo of the unit with the Bitmain 1600 watt PSU shortly.The power connection setup is a bit different than you are used to seeing on Antminers. The beefier controller requires a PCIe connection to feed it power. Each hashing board requires all three plugs connected and uses roughly 405 watts. What we did for this review was connect two of them to one PSU. Then connected the 3rd board and the controller to the other PSU. It is important to remember only to connect one PSU to a hashing board. Do not mix multiple PSUs on the same board. Also of note is to power on the PSU that does not power the controller first. This arrangement will mean the hashing boards are powering up first for the controller to detect when you power on that PSU last.When the Antminer S7 is running, the noise is less than expected for a dual fan unit that is having to dissipate the heat generated in such a small package. Bitmain did a good of pairing fans that are high CFM yet not screaming loud. The S7 is louder than the S5, but not as loud as the S5+. At 4 feet, it registers 66 dB. Most of the noise sounds like rushing air. There is no high pitched whine. While this may not be something you want to put in your living room, but it won’t drive you out of your garage either.0.25 J/GH on a 28nm DieBitmain’s simple to use software is on the controller with the current firmware version being dated August 29th. We did not find any bugs or glitches as we sometimes find that some miners have when we get them before the general public. The freq selection is set up simply and offers lots of options, so overclocking and downclocking is simple to do.The BM1385 ASIC is built using the 28nm process. In conversations with Jihan, he has stated that the 28nm process can be further optimized and with 28nm being a mature tech chips can be produced faster and cheaper while providing gains in performance. This performance gain is very obvious with the BM1385 ASIC as the power to gh/s ratio at 0.25 J/GH is very aggressive. The larger die size allows for a greater surface for heat dissipation as well. These things add up to an S7 that has a small form factor and solid performance.The Antminer S7 is a solid performing Bitcoin ASIC miner that is being sold to anyone. The familiar form factor that Bitmain debuted with the S1 is there. Adding the tweaks of the tongue and groove system on the chassis allowing for easier stacking coupled with a robust controller allow for new options for deployment. The performance is the best on the market right now that you can get your hands on for Bitcoin ASIC miners. Bitmain has stated they will begin shipping the last week of Sept to the first week or so of Oct for batch one. From how the unit we received for review works they have the process down and things look good for their shipping window.The Antminer S7 is a solid miner that will fit in well from small to large installations. The ease of use that is one of Bitmain’s hallmarks is there as well. The S7 on stock setting is putting out a reliable 4.9 th/s across Antpool, and Kano.is while pulling 1250 watts. It is a top performer like the S5 before it. The Bitcoin block reward halving will be happening at the end of July 2016 so getting your hands on the most efficient miners you can right now is crucial. The S7 is a great option.What are your thoughts on the Antminer S7?

10/09/2015,"['Singapore-based remittance startup Toast, previously known as Cryptosigma, has pivoted away from bitcoin and blockchain technology and reportedly raised $850,000 (S$1.2m) in seed funding.The startup – which seeks to facilitate remittances for Filipino workers living in Singapore – announced its re-branding in a blog post in July and said it would for now operate as a ""bitcoin invisible"" solution.The post read:""We realised as wonderful as bitcoin is, it is still not mass market suitable and we wanted to help make it so by deploying a product that a) solved a big problem right now (not 10 years from now) and b) a product that appealed to a large enough group of people with problem \'a\'.""A Startupbootcamp alumnus, Toast will now allow consumers to load its smartphone app – due to be released to Google\'s Play store – with a local offline travel card or bank account and send money to their relatives in the Philippines, thus bypassing traditional remittance agents.In so doing, Toast will tap into the Philippines remittance market, which according to a 2010 World Bank study is the second largest recipient for remittances in Asia, accounting for 10% of the country\'s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2014.', 'Commonwealth central bank governors say they want to look more closely into the impact of digital currencies on monetary policy before adopting a stance toward the technology.The comments came earlier this week during a meeting of about 30 central bank governors from the Commonwealth – an intergovernmental organization composed of 53 member-states. Held on 6th October and chaired by Bangladesh Central Bank governor Aitur Rahman, the event centered on bitcoin in the context of global remittances.Government ministers and other officials were also in attendance.The topic of digital currencies and cross-border payments served as part of a broader conversation about the negative impact of regulation on remittances, particularly the closure of accounts for money-related businesses that banks deem too risky to work with.Many startups working in the digital currency industry today, even in countries with more advanced understandings of the technology like Australia and the US, continue to struggle to gain access to even basic banking services.The meeting was intended to look at ""the potential of virtual currencies to decrease costs and improve the efficiency of transfers"" and included a presentation by London School of Economics historian and CoinDesk contributor Garrick Hileman on the state of digital currencies.While the potential for digital currencies to address remittance pain points was acknowledged by those in attendance, some governors at the meeting raised questions ""about the implications for monetary policy and financial stability"", according to the Commonwealth Secretariat.Jwala Rambarran, central bank governor for Trinidad and Tobago was quoted by the Commonwealth Secretariat as saying:""The Commonwealth Secretariat has a key role to play in sharing knowledge and developing research on the potential and implications of this new technology. If we decide to regulate virtual currencies, we are unaware of the financial instability risks posed by this currency. This is an area we need to determine carefully.""During the meeting, representatives also discussed best practices for describing the technology.Hileman characterized the meeting as a positive one, telling CoinDesk:""There was significant interest shown by many Commonwealth member countries in the potential of cryptocurrencies to have a positive impact on reducing costs and other inefficiencies in traditional remittance services.""Commonwealth flags image via Shutterstock.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

For a first-time offender and a non-violent offender at that, the sentence seemed somewhat excessive to many within and outside of the Bitcoin community. The reasoning behind Judge Forrest’s sentencing has now been unsealed for public review.Ross Ulbricht SentencingMassive sentences for non-violent drug offenses has been controversialThe explosion in the prison population within the United States has reached alarming proportions. More than 2 million citizens are currently in prison, by far the largest prison population for any nation. According to the latest statistics, the U.S. accounts for about 5% of the world’s population, but about 25% of the world’s prison population.This has largely been due to “The Rockefeller Laws” and “The War on Drugs” starting in the mid-1980’s. Over the last 20 years, the U.S. prison population has more than doubled. The sentencing in the Silk Road case is another example of how this happens so quickly in “The Land of the Free.”Before Ross Ulbricht’s sentencing on May 29, 2015, Judge Forrest spent the better part of an hour defending current drug laws and deriding Ulbricht’s crimes and defense. After spending over 100 hours pondering an appropriate sentence, and reviewing almost as many letters of testimony to the character of Ulbricht from friends and family, Judge Forrest stated:“What Silk Road really was, was a social market expander of a socially harmful drug that we have deemed in our democratic process to be unacceptable and it was an enabler of those trying so very hard to get away from it. What you did in connection with Silk Road was terribly destructive to our social fabric.”Judge Forrest saw the defense’s arguments as somewhat offensive, attacking the validity of the laws referenced in this case. Forrest seemed to use Ulbricht’s education and solid upbringing as reasons to be harsher with the defendant.“No drug dealer from the Bronx selling meth or heroin or crack has ever made these kinds of arguments to the Court,” Judge Forrest said. “It is a privileged argument, it is an argument from one of privilege. You are no better a person than any other drug dealer and your education does not give you a special place of privilege in our criminal justice system. It makes it less explicable why you did what you did.”Judge Forrest saw the case being so widely publicized as an opportunity to use the sentence as a deterrent against future offenses of this nature. She also saw Ulbricht as someone who thought he was “above the law” in building Silk Road for drug sales, so her final sentence was as severe as any ever handed out to an online webmaster.As we’ve reported here, Ross Ulbricht received two concurrent life sentences for narcotics trafficking, narcotics conspiracy and distribution of narcotics by means of the Internet. Three other counts included one count of conspiracy to commit computer hacking (5 years), one count of conspiracy to traffic in fraudulent identification documents (10 years), and one count of money laundering conspiracy (20 years). In addition, Ulbricht was fined US$183,961,921. Ulbricht is currently appealing his sentencing.Ross’s final statement to the court before sentencing was also released, and Ulbricht showed much contrition, even breaking down into tears, at one point. He apologized to the families of those who died from the drugs sold on Silk Road, as some spoke against him before sentencing. His time in jail since his arrest in the fall of 2013 gave him time to reflect, and gain respect for the laws he is said to have broken.“One of the things I have realized about the law is that the laws of nature are much like the laws of man,” said Ulbricht in court. “Gravity doesn't care if you agree with it––if you jump off a cliff you are still going to get hurt. And even though I didn't agree with the law, I still have been convicted of a crime and must be punished. I understand that now and I respect the law and the authority now.”Issues with how the case was handledThe court case and its handling was soundly ridiculed by filmmaker Alex Winter, who attended the court proceedings in person. He went on to chronicle the background of the case in his biopic “Deep Web”. He was of the opinion that Ulbricht’s defense team never received a fair opportunity to defend Ross, as any defense levied was thrown out by Judge Forrest in Winter’s view as a spectator.“I hope to see (the defense) get their day in court. That was the part that was very chilling and frustrating when I was in the courtroom,” Winter told Joe Rogan on Rogan’s podcast in April. “It was like, the prosecution said their piece, the defense was about to, bam, they got blocked (by Judge Forrest), it was over. (The defense) was unable to call expert witnesses, discuss the complexities of Bitcoin. I would just like to see the defense have its day.”Regarding issues with non-violent drug offense sentencing, Vice recently aired a special featuring President Barack Obama going to El Reno Federal Prison in Oklahoma regarding this exact issue. Called “Fixing The System,” President Obama was the first sitting President to ever visit a federal prison with the intent to talk to inmates and learn more about the societal byproducts of “The War on Drugs.” U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder was also interviewed by Shane Smith of Vice for the report.“Nobody ever lost an election because they were too tough on crime,” said President Obama to Vice’s Smith in El Reno. “Nobody stepped back and asked ‘Is it really appropriate for someone who is engaged in a serious, but non-violent, drug offense, to get more time than a rapist?"", 'The final chapter in the case of the United States of America vs Ross Ulbricht’s assets, from the Silk Road seizure, is coming to a conclusion in a few short weeks. The US Marshals Service (USMS) has now announced that the remaining 44,341.55308401 BTC, held in connection with the criminal conviction and civil forfeiture action against Ulbricht, will be auctioned off in early November.Out of the total bitcoin seized, approximately 29,655 were recovered from servers used to run the Silk Road website, and approximately 144,336 were from computer hardware belonging to Ulbricht, and were seized when he was arrested.There have been four USMS auctions for bitcoin relating to Ross Ulbricht and the Silk Road case, two in 2014 and two in 2015, with the very last auction scheduled for November 5. All auctions are online-only, and bidders must be pre-approved by the USMS.Before the first auction, all of the bitcoins that were part of the civil forfeiture and criminal action brought against Ross Ulbricht, and the assets of Silk Road previously held in an FBI wallet, were transferred into two U.S. Marshals wallets. The first wallet held bitcoin for the first auction, and the other wallet held approximately 144,342 remaining bitcoins.The first auction took place on June 27, 2014, from 6 a.m. until 6 p.m. EST, lasting 12 hours. Almost 30,000 bitcoins were auctioned in 10 blocks, and the duration of this first auction was twice as long as the other auctions. The price of bitcoin dropped before the end of the auction but rose substantially by the end of the auction period.At the end of that historic first auction, the USMS said on their website that one bidder had stepped forward to pick up all of the blocks, worth about US$17.7 million. A few days later, on July 2, Bitcoin VC Tim Draper announced to the world that he was the winning bidder, and would be using those coins for liquidity on the OTC derivatives platform Mirror. July 2 was another bullish day for bitcoin, with a similar volume spike.The second auction came almost six months later, on December 4, 2014, from 8:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m. EST, when exactly 50,000 bitcoins were auctioned in 20 blocks. This time the auction lasted only six hours, and similar to the first auction, the price of bitcoin rose, although a major selloff had occurred just two hours before the auction commenced.Almost immediately after the second auction the winner of 19 of those 20 blocks, worth about US$18m, revealed themselves. It was a syndicate of 104 investors pooling their money together to buy some cheap coins, all led by bitcoin advocate and Venture Capitalist Barry Silbert.The following day the USMS confirmed it was Silbert’s group, saying ""Because SecondMarket has voluntarily come forward, we can confirm that it was the winner of 48,000 bitcoins, and the transfer of those bitcoins was completed Monday.” They also revealed that the number of bidders registered for the second auction was about a quarter of the number of those registered for the first. We later learned that the remaining block of 2,000 bitcoins had been picked up by Tim Draper, adding to his holdings.Three months later, on March 5, and also for six hours between 8:00am EST and 2:00pm EST, the USMS auctioned the third batch of 50,000 more bitcoins, which were put up for auction in 20 blocks. The price of bitcoin dipped slightly during the sale, only to shoot up soon after the auction. Again, a major selloff preceded the auction, this time by 15 hours.Less is known about the winners of this auction, except that there were three winners, and New York-based exchange itBit reported that it had picked up the first 3,000 coins. The second winner is completely unknown, but the final winner is suspected of having ties to a mysterious company called Cumberland Mining & Materials LLC, which has a very cryptic website displaying a mining cart and an email address. So basically, there are 47,000 bitcoins out there from this auction that are no longer in the government’s hands, but only the USMS knows the real identity of their owners.Here we are, almost eight months later, and the final auction for 22 blocks of bitcoins is round the corner. Like the two previous auctions, this auction will be for six hours, and run from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. EST on November 5.As with previous auctions, interested participants must first pre-register through the USMS website, between October 19 and November 2. Potential bidders must have completed all registration requirements and received an official Bid Form from the USMS to participate in the auction. Bids will only be accepted by email, and foreign citizens can participate as long as all deposit and purchase funds are from a US bank.After this auction there should be no more large caches of confiscated, federally held bitcoins, as the US Department of Justice has not announced any more substantial bitcoin seizures. In addition, the USMS has not announced any more holding of bitcoins either. Therefore, the risk of the US government releasing a substantial amount of bitcoin, flooding the market and sending the price of bitcoin on a downward spiral at exchanges, should soon be eliminated.With the potential risk of bitcoin flooding the market substantially reduced, investor confidence in the price of bitcoin should improve to some extent. As we’ve seen in the three previous auctions, some sell-offs were observed either before or during the auction, but bitcoin prices eventually finished higher during or soon after the auction period.', 'Podjetje GreCom je na bencinskem servisu Petrol na Celovški v Ljubljani postavilo že ?etrti bankomat.

Held on 6th October and chaired by Bangladesh Central Bank governor Aitur Rahman, the event centered on bitcoin in the context of global remittances.Government ministers and other officials were also in attendance.The topic of digital currencies and cross-border payments served as part of a broader conversation about the negative impact of regulation on remittances, particularly the closure of accounts for money-related businesses that banks deem too risky to work with.Many startups working in the digital currency industry today, even in countries with more advanced understandings of the technology like Australia and the US, continue to struggle to gain access to even basic banking services.The meeting was intended to look at ""the potential of virtual currencies to decrease costs and improve the efficiency of transfers"" and included a presentation by London School of Economics historian and CoinDesk contributor Garrick Hileman on the state of digital currencies.While the potential for digital currencies to address remittance pain points was acknowledged by those in attendance, some governors at the meeting raised questions ""about the implications for monetary policy and financial stability"", according to the Commonwealth Secretariat.Jwala Rambarran, central bank governor for Trinidad and Tobago was quoted by the Commonwealth Secretariat as saying:""The Commonwealth Secretariat has a key role to play in sharing knowledge and developing research on the potential and implications of this new technology.

This is an area we need to determine carefully.""During the meeting, representatives also discussed best practices for describing the technology.Hileman characterized the meeting as a positive one, telling CoinDesk:""There was significant interest shown by many Commonwealth member countries in the potential of cryptocurrencies to have a positive impact on reducing costs and other inefficiencies in traditional remittance services.""Commonwealth flags image via Shutterstock.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

For a first-time offender and a non-violent offender at that, the sentence seemed somewhat excessive to many within and outside of the Bitcoin community. The reasoning behind Judge Forrest’s sentencing has now been unsealed for public review.Ross Ulbricht SentencingMassive sentences for non-violent drug offenses has been controversialThe explosion in the prison population within the United States has reached alarming proportions. More than 2 million citizens are currently in prison, by far the largest prison population for any nation. According to the latest statistics, the U.S. accounts for about 5% of the world’s population, but about 25% of the world’s prison population.This has largely been due to “The Rockefeller Laws” and “The War on Drugs” starting in the mid-1980’s. Over the last 20 years, the U.S. prison population has more than doubled. The sentencing in the Silk Road case is another example of how this happens so quickly in “The Land of the Free.”Before Ross Ulbricht’s sentencing on May 29, 2015, Judge Forrest spent the better part of an hour defending current drug laws and deriding Ulbricht’s crimes and defense. After spending over 100 hours pondering an appropriate sentence, and reviewing almost as many letters of testimony to the character of Ulbricht from friends and family, Judge Forrest stated:“What Silk Road really was, was a social market expander of a socially harmful drug that we have deemed in our democratic process to be unacceptable and it was an enabler of those trying so very hard to get away from it. What you did in connection with Silk Road was terribly destructive to our social fabric.”Judge Forrest saw the defense’s arguments as somewhat offensive, attacking the validity of the laws referenced in this case. Forrest seemed to use Ulbricht’s education and solid upbringing as reasons to be harsher with the defendant.“No drug dealer from the Bronx selling meth or heroin or crack has ever made these kinds of arguments to the Court,” Judge Forrest said. “It is a privileged argument, it is an argument from one of privilege. You are no better a person than any other drug dealer and your education does not give you a special place of privilege in our criminal justice system. It makes it less explicable why you did what you did.”Judge Forrest saw the case being so widely publicized as an opportunity to use the sentence as a deterrent against future offenses of this nature. She also saw Ulbricht as someone who thought he was “above the law” in building Silk Road for drug sales, so her final sentence was as severe as any ever handed out to an online webmaster.As we’ve reported here, Ross Ulbricht received two concurrent life sentences for narcotics trafficking, narcotics conspiracy and distribution of narcotics by means of the Internet. Three other counts included one count of conspiracy to commit computer hacking (5 years), one count of conspiracy to traffic in fraudulent identification documents (10 years), and one count of money laundering conspiracy (20 years). In addition, Ulbricht was fined US$183,961,921. Ulbricht is currently appealing his sentencing.Ross’s final statement to the court before sentencing was also released, and Ulbricht showed much contrition, even breaking down into tears, at one point. He apologized to the families of those who died from the drugs sold on Silk Road, as some spoke against him before sentencing. His time in jail since his arrest in the fall of 2013 gave him time to reflect, and gain respect for the laws he is said to have broken.“One of the things I have realized about the law is that the laws of nature are much like the laws of man,” said Ulbricht in court. “Gravity doesn't care if you agree with it––if you jump off a cliff you are still going to get hurt. And even though I didn't agree with the law, I still have been convicted of a crime and must be punished. I understand that now and I respect the law and the authority now.”Issues with how the case was handledThe court case and its handling was soundly ridiculed by filmmaker Alex Winter, who attended the court proceedings in person. He went on to chronicle the background of the case in his biopic “Deep Web”. He was of the opinion that Ulbricht’s defense team never received a fair opportunity to defend Ross, as any defense levied was thrown out by Judge Forrest in Winter’s view as a spectator.“I hope to see (the defense) get their day in court. That was the part that was very chilling and frustrating when I was in the courtroom,” Winter told Joe Rogan on Rogan’s podcast in April. “It was like, the prosecution said their piece, the defense was about to, bam, they got blocked (by Judge Forrest), it was over. (The defense) was unable to call expert witnesses, discuss the complexities of Bitcoin. I would just like to see the defense have its day.”Regarding issues with non-violent drug offense sentencing, Vice recently aired a special featuring President Barack Obama going to El Reno Federal Prison in Oklahoma regarding this exact issue. Called “Fixing The System,” President Obama was the first sitting President to ever visit a federal prison with the intent to talk to inmates and learn more about the societal byproducts of “The War on Drugs.” U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder was also interviewed by Shane Smith of Vice for the report.“Nobody ever lost an election because they were too tough on crime,” said President Obama to Vice’s Smith in El Reno. “Nobody stepped back and asked ‘Is it really appropriate for someone who is engaged in a serious, but non-violent, drug offense, to get more time than a rapist?"", 'The final chapter in the case of the United States of America vs Ross Ulbricht’s assets, from the Silk Road seizure, is coming to a conclusion in a few short weeks. The US Marshals Service (USMS) has now announced that the remaining 44,341.55308401 BTC, held in connection with the criminal conviction and civil forfeiture action against Ulbricht, will be auctioned off in early November.Out of the total bitcoin seized, approximately 29,655 were recovered from servers used to run the Silk Road website, and approximately 144,336 were from computer hardware belonging to Ulbricht, and were seized when he was arrested.There have been four USMS auctions for bitcoin relating to Ross Ulbricht and the Silk Road case, two in 2014 and two in 2015, with the very last auction scheduled for November 5. All auctions are online-only, and bidders must be pre-approved by the USMS.Before the first auction, all of the bitcoins that were part of the civil forfeiture and criminal action brought against Ross Ulbricht, and the assets of Silk Road previously held in an FBI wallet, were transferred into two U.S. Marshals wallets. The first wallet held bitcoin for the first auction, and the other wallet held approximately 144,342 remaining bitcoins.The first auction took place on June 27, 2014, from 6 a.m. until 6 p.m. EST, lasting 12 hours. Almost 30,000 bitcoins were auctioned in 10 blocks, and the duration of this first auction was twice as long as the other auctions.

10/18/2015,"['With the virtual reality market predicted to be worth US$30b by 2020, it\'s no wonder Venture Capital is pouring into the industry from the likes of Ashton Kutcher and Samsung. With bitcoin and blockchain technology companies also benefiting on the investment front, a collision of the two industries was inevitable as companies reach for a slice of the pie.Aside from attracting Venture Capital, the digital currency industry has always been inherently drawn towards crowdfunding. The creators of an end-to-end virtual reality (VR) content creation platform, Voxelus, recently announced a 30-day crowdsale of the cryptographically secure in-game token, called “Voxels.”According to the company\'s co-founder and CEO, Martin Repetto, Voxels will be the only method of payment on the platform’s upcoming Content Marketplace for VR assets, which is set to launch in early 2016. Items for sale on the market will include animations, immersive worlds and games, some of which will be made by users of the platform itself.The public sale will commence on the 2nd November, and is being handled by ShapeShift. The European based exchange is no stranger to token sales, EverdreamSoft partnered with ShapeShift for their Spells of Genesis BitCrystal token sale, in July.- Shaban Shaame, EverdreamSoft CEO and FounderThe Voxelus platform was designed to allow anyone to create Virtual Reality content, a current lack of which is a sticking point for upcoming VR platforms. Voxelus Creator, a 3D design app for PC and Mac, will allow users make new VR experiences and virtual spaces, all without writing a single line of code. Voxelus also features a stand-alone VR player app, which works on desktop PCs, and plays the content on the Oculus Rift or Samsung VR.- OculusThe idea of virtual reality has been around since before the 1950s, traces can be seen in Stanley G. Weinbaum’s short story, “Pygmalion’s Spectacles,” which is recognised as the first work of science fiction to mention VR.The current generation of headsets in development, including the Oculus Rift, are arguably a real-life version of Pygmalion’s Spectacles. The Rift came into being through it’s own crowdfund, a kickstarter campaign which raised just over US$2m, in August 2012. Just two years later, Facebook purchased the project for US$2b. Mark Zuckerberg, the Founder and CEO of Facebook, said at the time that, “Virtual reality was once the dream of science fiction. But the internet was also once a dream, and so were computers and smartphones. The future is coming and we have a chance to build it together”Leveraging the buzz around Rift, Voxelus seized the opportunity to announce the public crowdsale at the Oculus Connect 2 developer conference, which took place three weeks ago in Los Angeles. The event, which focused on the Oculus Platform and pushing virtual reality forward, attracted over 1000 engineers, designers, and creatives from around the world.Preceding the public sale, Voxels have been available to strategic partners and cryptocurrency investors in a private sale, where they received 1200 Voxel per bitcoin, with a minimum purchase of 100,000. During the public crowdsale, taking place on the site sale.voxelus.com, buyers can acquire 1000 Voxel per bitcoin in the first 24 hours, followed by three tranches of 900, 800 and 750 Voxel per bitcoin. There is a minimum order of 100 voxels, selling for US$25 - US$30. The sale will last 30 days or until 31.5 million Voxel are sold, representing 15 percent of the total supply, 210 million.Voxelus is not the first digital currency company announcing a crowdsale to fund a VR project this year. Wendell Davis arranged a private sale in late January, with assistance from crowdfunding platform Koinify, for project Vizor, “the Youtube of virtual reality.”Vizor released their own token VIZR, for the sale. Davis, who is the co-founder at Vizor, explained that he is a big believer in crypto tokens and thinks they will pair well with VR, in an interview with BraveNewCoin.The plan for VIZR sounds much the same as the the plan for Voxels. Down the line, the VIZR token will be tradable for anything, from virtual furniture to a film screening in a virtual theatre, “the possibilities are endless and no coding is required,” said Davis. “The VIZR token can also be used to tip content creators, and purchase advertising and other premium features in the Vizor ecosystem.”The Vizor team have also experimented with Adam B.Levine’s idea of token controlled viewpoints in VR. “If you had a certain token within your wallet, say we called it ‘Vizor Door’, then a door would appear in your world,” said Davis.Adam B.Levine wrote a blog exploring this topic, called Token Controlled Viewpoint (TCV) Genesis, Characteristics and Early Use Cases. In it he explains that Token Controlled Viewpoints are an application of Token Controlled Access (TCA ), where users gain access to content by holding a specific token.- Adam B. LevineVizor appears to still be in Beta mode and have not made any official announcements since their private crowdsale, although their twitter account occasionally posts updates, the last one was May this year.Voxelus, however, have taken a slightly different approach with their public sale. The team have attracted not only ShapeShift, and the influence that Erik Voorhees brings with him, but also Halsey Minor, chairman and co-founder of Voxelus and chairman and founder of the exchange Uphold.Uphold, formerly known as Bitreserve, announced that Voxels will be the only digital currency other than bitcoin that is supported by the platform. ""Early in my career, I was influenced by the visions of writers such as Neal Stephenson in books like Snow Crash that envisioned worlds with both virtual money and virtual reality,” said Minor. “Making science fiction science fact is the kind of thing every entrepreneur lives for.""', 'Bitcoin and altcoin exchange Cryptsy (Project Investors, Inc.) may be in a serious trouble, with one report over the weekend claiming that the exchange is refusing to allow users to cash out.A report from The Merkle goes as far as claiming that the company has “gone full Mt Gox” (a reference to failed Japanese Bitcoin exchange Mt Gox) and that customers have had their funds frozen or were locked out of their account and are unable to withdraw coins.It’s suggested that the downfall of Cryptsy may be related to the company being involved in a GAW Miners/ Paycoin ponzi scheme, in particular that Cryptsy held a Prime Controller for Paycoin and profited from the scam; it was reported earlier this month that Cryptsy was under Federal investigation for its involvement with Paycoin, and not from one agency but several: the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the Criminal Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue Service.The report links to multiple users who have complained on popular Bitcoin forum Bitcointalk going back months who all have a similar story: they are unable to withdraw funds from Cryptsy, they have either been ignored by support or threatened with losing their accounts for constantly contacting support; in one case one user claims that Cryptsy changed the password on his account and wouldn’t let him access it.This isn’t the first time Cryptsy has been in the spotlight for poor behavior with the company being sued in 2014 due to its links to the also now notorious Bitcoin Savings & Trust ponzi scheme.Complaints, in that case, included that Cryptsy using deceptive and misleading tactics such as the promise of high profits based on seven percent weekly interest; not providing a safe and reliable platform to trade cryptocurrencies; and excessive fees and commissions, among others.No surpriseCryptsy appears to be continuing to trade and take deposits at the time of writing but in the world of dodgy Bitcoin exchanges we’ve seen this before; the more important aspect is whether users are able to withdraw their funds, and answer currently would appear to be no.If they have “gone Mt Gox” it’s of absolutely no surprise whatsoever, given the company’s previous involvement with some of the worst scammers and criminals to have ever operated in the Bitcoin space; that people would still trust the services of this company in October 2015 despite the nefarious company they keep is a sad reflection that either people don’t do some basic due diligence about the people they trade with, or just don’t care, and although there are legitimate victims here, the Latin phrase Caveat Emptor comes to mind.Cryptsy is one of the ever shrinking pre-regulation, old school exchanges complete with Belize registration at a time where the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space has moved to transparency and financial compliance through venture capital backed companies such as Coinbase and Gemini, taking Bitcoin to a broader, more publicly acceptable space.The death of Cryptsy will be sad for those who lose money, but good for Bitcoin in the long term as the market can only progress once it is purged of those who are willing to steal and defraud users.', 'T0.com , a majority owned subsidiary of Overstock.com incorporated has some good news to share with the cryptocurrency community. The company has recently concluded yet another successful production beta test of its platform. According to a press release the company has successfully recorded the platform’s compliance with the regulations on bitcoin blockchain.T0.com is a bitcoin blockchain based trading platform. Like any other platform involved in trading, the company is required to meet the compliance requirements as stated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission among others. The recent production beta test successfully tested the ability to record the evidence of compliance with SEC Regulation SHO before a trader attempts to short sell. This is a significant breakthrough for the company as it will enable T0.com to efficiently make use of blockchain technology in trading to ensure transparency and fairness by recording all the information on blockchain.In the press release, the CEO of T0.com, Parick M Byrne praises blockchain technology as the most important financial development of our lifetimes and he also proudly states that the company has utilized blockchain technology to create a working product which will be operational shortly while others are just theorizing about the innovations that are possible using blockchain technology. By using blockchain technology T0.com is attempting to bring transparency into a market which doesn’t have any.Excerpt of Byrne’s quote from press release –“When up and running, each Pre-borrow Assured Token will provide the purchaser a valid locate satisfying the SEC’s Regulation SHO requirements. These tokens will be auctioned nightly in a Dutch auction using t0 software and the transaction will be recorded on the blockchain. In the process, the arcane world of stock loan receives sunlight.”He explains that the Pre-borrow Assured Token issued by T0.com to qualified institutional buyers and sellers on the platform will allow beneficial owners to bring their inventory into a transparent market. At the same time, short sellers will benefit by being able to borrow in a transparent market. Increased transparency is also good for regulators as they don’t have to go digging too deep into records to ensure compliance.', 'Boost VC, a well-known accelerator among startups and the bitcoin community recently had a demo day for its latest cohort.

Lose 10 pounds of belly fat in just one week? Bankers hate this one weird trick by a pair of top economists: this 179-page book tells all about it! Still here? Then, in the parlance of George Akerlof and Robert Shiller, I have phished you for a phool. The term “phishing” comes from scam emails but Bob and George, as these Nobel laureates in economics style themselves, define it more broadly as businesses “getting people to do things that are in the interests of the phishermen but not in the interest of the target”. It happens whenever there is an opportunity to appeal to the “monkey on our shoulder” — the part of our brains that like nicotine, folksy-but-fake politicians and 15 per cent investment returns. Phishing for Phools has a host of examples — from used car dealers to credit card usurers, from junk food to junk credits — where the authors feel free markets exploit consumers’ lack of knowledge or self-control and turn them into the “phools” who fall for the sales ploys. This line of argument has a long history. Where Akerlof and Shiller break new ground is the sweeping application of the idea of the “phishing equilibrium” to finance. But for two such insightful economists, the concept is curiously under-developed. For an example, consider bank overdrafts in the UK. In the authors’ terms, the high interest rates and penalty fees make them a phish, from which nobody benefits. But is this correct? The phishermen, in this case the retail banks, find their phools by offering the British population free bank accounts. The cost of that is paid for by those weak, stupid or unlucky enough to go into debt. Avoid using your overdraft, however, and UK bank accounts are a great deal. Another case is the recent phenomenon of free-to-play online games. Here all the revenue comes from the 1 or 2 per cent of players addicted enough, or impatient enough, to pay for power-ups and in-game items. The other 98 per cent are pure winners. They get a free game that would not otherwise exist. This is surely a phish, but it does not just benefit the phishermen. The phools are subsidising other customers. So while a phishing equilibrium may well be unfair, as the money often comes from those who can least afford it, others may benefit. This kind of market structure can therefore be popular — a possibility Akerlof and Shiller do not address in their book. With their description of “reputation mining” by credit rating agencies, who caught out unwary investors by offering triple-A rated securities that turned out not to be, the authors make a strong case that phishing was part of the financial crisis. But putting it at the heart of the story goes too far: it makes one look for the evil mastermind scamster behind it all, when Lehman Brothers and its ilk were phools as much as phishers. The problem of the rating agencies is that they are still paid by the banks selling bonds and not the investors who rely on the ratings. Akerlof and Shiller devote two chapters to the 1980s savings and loans crisis, when about 1,000 small US banks went under after interest rates were raised, but not until they had first poured cash into Wall Street trader Michael Milken’s junk bonds. Some junk bond investors were surely phished. The savings and loan operators knew what they were up to, however — that was the scam. Akerlof’s deservedly famous paper with Paul Romer describes the S&L crisis as “looting” not “phishing”. It seems a more apt and interesting word. The style of Phishing for Phools will be familiar to fans of Shiller’s work: light on jargon and pacy enough not to outstay its welcome. The authors tell some engaging tales, although usually at the remove of a fellow academic’s research. There is not much grime or anguish, dialogue or doubt. The brilliant, catchy title will sell Phishing for Phools. Indeed, it is almost as if Bob and George want to tempt the monkey on the shoulder of the book-buying public. They give their readers a breezy ride through some modern behavioural economics — and if they leave them hungry for a little more nutrition, well, what clever marketer does not?

Voxelus Creator, a 3D design app for PC and Mac, will allow users make new VR experiences and virtual spaces, all without writing a single line of code. Voxelus also features a stand-alone VR player app, which works on desktop PCs, and plays the content on the Oculus Rift or Samsung VR.- OculusThe idea of virtual reality has been around since before the 1950s, traces can be seen in Stanley G. Weinbaum’s short story, “Pygmalion’s Spectacles,” which is recognised as the first work of science fiction to mention VR.The current generation of headsets in development, including the Oculus Rift, are arguably a real-life version of Pygmalion’s Spectacles. The Rift came into being through it’s own crowdfund, a kickstarter campaign which raised just over US$2m, in August 2012. Just two years later, Facebook purchased the project for US$2b. Mark Zuckerberg, the Founder and CEO of Facebook, said at the time that, “Virtual reality was once the dream of science fiction. But the internet was also once a dream, and so were computers and smartphones. The future is coming and we have a chance to build it together”Leveraging the buzz around Rift, Voxelus seized the opportunity to announce the public crowdsale at the Oculus Connect 2 developer conference, which took place three weeks ago in Los Angeles. The event, which focused on the Oculus Platform and pushing virtual reality forward, attracted over 1000 engineers, designers, and creatives from around the world.Preceding the public sale, Voxels have been available to strategic partners and cryptocurrency investors in a private sale, where they received 1200 Voxel per bitcoin, with a minimum purchase of 100,000. During the public crowdsale, taking place on the site sale.voxelus.com, buyers can acquire 1000 Voxel per bitcoin in the first 24 hours, followed by three tranches of 900, 800 and 750 Voxel per bitcoin. There is a minimum order of 100 voxels, selling for US$25 - US$30. The sale will last 30 days or until 31.5 million Voxel are sold, representing 15 percent of the total supply, 210 million.Voxelus is not the first digital currency company announcing a crowdsale to fund a VR project this year. Wendell Davis arranged a private sale in late January, with assistance from crowdfunding platform Koinify, for project Vizor, “the Youtube of virtual reality.”Vizor released their own token VIZR, for the sale. Davis, who is the co-founder at Vizor, explained that he is a big believer in crypto tokens and thinks they will pair well with VR, in an interview with BraveNewCoin.The plan for VIZR sounds much the same as the the plan for Voxels. Down the line, the VIZR token will be tradable for anything, from virtual furniture to a film screening in a virtual theatre, “the possibilities are endless and no coding is required,” said Davis. “The VIZR token can also be used to tip content creators, and purchase advertising and other premium features in the Vizor ecosystem.”The Vizor team have also experimented with Adam B.Levine’s idea of token controlled viewpoints in VR. “If you had a certain token within your wallet, say we called it ‘Vizor Door’, then a door would appear in your world,” said Davis.Adam B.Levine wrote a blog exploring this topic, called Token Controlled Viewpoint (TCV) Genesis, Characteristics and Early Use Cases. In it he explains that Token Controlled Viewpoints are an application of Token Controlled Access (TCA ), where users gain access to content by holding a specific token.- Adam B. LevineVizor appears to still be in Beta mode and have not made any official announcements since their private crowdsale, although their twitter account occasionally posts updates, the last one was May this year.Voxelus, however, have taken a slightly different approach with their public sale. The team have attracted not only ShapeShift, and the influence that Erik Voorhees brings with him, but also Halsey Minor, chairman and co-founder of Voxelus and chairman and founder of the exchange Uphold.Uphold, formerly known as Bitreserve, announced that Voxels will be the only digital currency other than bitcoin that is supported by the platform. ""Early in my career, I was influenced by the visions of writers such as Neal Stephenson in books like Snow Crash that envisioned worlds with both virtual money and virtual reality,” said Minor. “Making science fiction science fact is the kind of thing every entrepreneur lives for.""', 'Bitcoin and altcoin exchange Cryptsy (Project Investors, Inc.) may be in a serious trouble, with one report over the weekend claiming that the exchange is refusing to allow users to cash out.A report from The Merkle goes as far as claiming that the company has “gone full Mt Gox” (a reference to failed Japanese Bitcoin exchange Mt Gox) and that customers have had their funds frozen or were locked out of their account and are unable to withdraw coins.It’s suggested that the downfall of Cryptsy may be related to the company being involved in a GAW Miners/ Paycoin ponzi scheme, in particular that Cryptsy held a Prime Controller for Paycoin and profited from the scam; it was reported earlier this month that Cryptsy was under Federal investigation for its involvement with Paycoin, and not from one agency but several: the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the Criminal Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue Service.The report links to multiple users who have complained on popular Bitcoin forum Bitcointalk going back months who all have a similar story: they are unable to withdraw funds from Cryptsy, they have either been ignored by support or threatened with losing their accounts for constantly contacting support; in one case one user claims that Cryptsy changed the password on his account and wouldn’t let him access it.This isn’t the first time Cryptsy has been in the spotlight for poor behavior with the company being sued in 2014 due to its links to the also now notorious Bitcoin Savings & Trust ponzi scheme.Complaints, in that case, included that Cryptsy using deceptive and misleading tactics such as the promise of high profits based on seven percent weekly interest; not providing a safe and reliable platform to trade cryptocurrencies; and excessive fees and commissions, among others.No surpriseCryptsy appears to be continuing to trade and take deposits at the time of writing but in the world of dodgy Bitcoin exchanges we’ve seen this before; the more important aspect is whether users are able to withdraw their funds, and answer currently would appear to be no.If they have “gone Mt Gox” it’s of absolutely no surprise whatsoever, given the company’s previous involvement with some of the worst scammers and criminals to have ever operated in the Bitcoin space; that people would still trust the services of this company in October 2015 despite the nefarious company they keep is a sad reflection that either people don’t do some basic due diligence about the people they trade with, or just don’t care, and although there are legitimate victims here, the Latin phrase Caveat Emptor comes to mind.Cryptsy is one of the ever shrinking pre-regulation, old school exchanges complete with Belize registration at a time where the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space has moved to transparency and financial compliance through venture capital backed companies such as Coinbase and Gemini, taking Bitcoin to a broader, more publicly acceptable space.The death of Cryptsy will be sad for those who lose money, but good for Bitcoin in the long term as the market can only progress once it is purged of those who are willing to steal and defraud users.', 'T0.com , a majority owned subsidiary of Overstock.com incorporated has some good news to share with the cryptocurrency community. The company has recently concluded yet another successful production beta test of its platform. According to a press release the company has successfully recorded the platform’s compliance with the regulations on bitcoin blockchain.T0.com is a bitcoin blockchain based trading platform. Like any other platform involved in trading, the company is required to meet the compliance requirements as stated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission among others. The recent production beta test successfully tested the ability to record the evidence of compliance with SEC Regulation SHO before a trader attempts to short sell. This is a significant breakthrough for the company as it will enable T0.com to efficiently make use of blockchain technology in trading to ensure transparency and fairness by recording all the information on blockchain.In the press release, the CEO of T0.com, Parick M Byrne praises blockchain technology as the most important financial development of our lifetimes and he also proudly states that the company has utilized blockchain technology to create a working product which will be operational shortly while others are just theorizing about the innovations that are possible using blockchain technology. By using blockchain technology T0.com is attempting to bring transparency into a market which doesn’t have any.Excerpt of Byrne’s quote from press release –“When up and running, each Pre-borrow Assured Token will provide the purchaser a valid locate satisfying the SEC’s Regulation SHO requirements. These tokens will be auctioned nightly in a Dutch auction using t0 software and the transaction will be recorded on the blockchain. In the process, the arcane world of stock loan receives sunlight.”He explains that the Pre-borrow Assured Token issued by T0.com to qualified institutional buyers and sellers on the platform will allow beneficial owners to bring their inventory into a transparent market. At the same time, short sellers will benefit by being able to borrow in a transparent market. Increased transparency is also good for regulators as they don’t have to go digging too deep into records to ensure compliance.', 'Boost VC, a well-known accelerator among startups and the bitcoin community recently had a demo day for its latest cohort.

Lose 10 pounds of belly fat in just one week? Bankers hate this one weird trick by a pair of top economists: this 179-page book tells all about it! Still here? Then, in the parlance of George Akerlof and Robert Shiller, I have phished you for a phool. The term “phishing” comes from scam emails but Bob and George, as these Nobel laureates in economics style themselves, define it more broadly as businesses “getting people to do things that are in the interests of the phishermen but not in the interest of the target”. It happens whenever there is an opportunity to appeal to the “monkey on our shoulder” — the part of our brains that like nicotine, folksy-but-fake politicians and 15 per cent investment returns. Phishing for Phools has a host of examples — from used car dealers to credit card usurers, from junk food to junk credits — where the authors feel free markets exploit consumers’ lack of knowledge or self-control and turn them into the “phools” who fall for the sales ploys. This line of argument has a long history. Where Akerlof and Shiller break new ground is the sweeping application of the idea of the “phishing equilibrium” to finance. But for two such insightful economists, the concept is curiously under-developed. For an example, consider bank overdrafts in the UK. In the authors’ terms, the high interest rates and penalty fees make them a phish, from which nobody benefits. But is this correct? The phishermen, in this case the retail banks, find their phools by offering the British population free bank accounts. The cost of that is paid for by those weak, stupid or unlucky enough to go into debt. Avoid using your overdraft, however, and UK bank accounts are a great deal. Another case is the recent phenomenon of free-to-play online games. Here all the revenue comes from the 1 or 2 per cent of players addicted enough, or impatient enough, to pay for power-ups and in-game items. The other 98 per cent are pure winners. They get a free game that would not otherwise exist. This is surely a phish, but it does not just benefit the phishermen. The phools are subsidising other customers. So while a phishing equilibrium may well be unfair, as the money often comes from those who can least afford it, others may benefit. This kind of market structure can therefore be popular — a possibility Akerlof and Shiller do not address in their book. With their description of “reputation mining” by credit rating agencies, who caught out unwary investors by offering triple-A rated securities that turned out not to be, the authors make a strong case that phishing was part of the financial crisis. But putting it at the heart of the story goes too far: it makes one look for the evil mastermind scamster behind it all, when Lehman Brothers and its ilk were phools as much as phishers. The problem of the rating agencies is that they are still paid by the banks selling bonds and not the investors who rely on the ratings. Akerlof and Shiller devote two chapters to the 1980s savings and loans crisis, when about 1,000 small US banks went under after interest rates were raised, but not until they had first poured cash into Wall Street trader Michael Milken’s junk bonds. Some junk bond investors were surely phished. The savings and loan operators knew what they were up to, however — that was the scam. Akerlof’s deservedly famous paper with Paul Romer describes the S&L crisis as “looting” not “phishing”. It seems a more apt and interesting word. The style of Phishing for Phools will be familiar to fans of Shiller’s work: light on jargon and pacy enough not to outstay its welcome. The authors tell some engaging tales, although usually at the remove of a fellow academic’s research. There is not much grime or anguish, dialogue or doubt. The brilliant, catchy title will sell Phishing for Phools. Indeed, it is almost as if Bob and George want to tempt the monkey on the shoulder of the book-buying public. They give their readers a breezy ride through some modern behavioural economics — and if they leave them hungry for a little more nutrition, well, what clever marketer does not?

""[Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein] was the most senior person in the Department in April and May 2010 who was in a position to identify the similarity between the inappropriate tactics used in Operations Wide Receiver and Fast and Furious,"" states the report.While believing in good engagement with law enforcement, Fenton was quick to point out that these particular are not lawmakers or regulators, just enforcers. “no amount of convincing will get them to relax, consider or change policy.”- FentonAlthough less vocal, one of the first venture capital investors in bitcoin, Roger Ver, appears to agree with Fentons opposition, stating that “regulators aren\'t adept at catching bad actors, but are far more adept at creating hurdles for legitimate business.”There have been many others weighing in on forums and social media, questioning the possibility of backdoors being built into bitcoin service provider platforms. Legally mandated backdoors for data access have been an ongoing topic of discussion in the US.The Obama Administration recently said that it won’t support legislation forcing firms to decode encrypted messages. But this didn’t provide much solace for privacy advocates, the administration says it will pursue other means to get people’s data.This means that the federal government won’t be forcing companies to build backdoor access into their services and devices any time soon, a measure that many intelligence agencies have been asking for.Instead of pushing for formal legislation mandating backdoors, the administration has decided that it will continue its efforts to informally pressure companies into creating a way for the government to look at people’s data when they are under investigation.- FBI Director James B. ComeyJerry Brito reiterated this point, “The Blockchain Alliance is not a backdoor for the government to get information about companies or their customers.”- BritoVer disagrees, “It\'s also important to remember that the biggest danger in this world isn\'t from evil people. It is from good people who blindly obey the orders of evil people because they imagine them to have ""authority."" Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and other evil people wouldn\'t have been able to accomplish anything if it wasn\'t for the basically good people who blindly followed their orders.”Core Developer Gavin Andresen, who is the Bitcoin Foundation’s Chief Scientist, doesn’t agree with Ver in this case, and believes that engaging with law enforcement will help bitcoin grow. “I still think engaging is the best strategy.”- Gavin AndresenNo one appears to doubt that the Alliance members’ intentions are sincere, but it is clear that experts in the bitcoin space are divided on whether the endeavour will be useful or damaging. Perhaps Andreas Antonopoulos provided the most persuasive argument, when he stated the alliance is a “terrible idea.”- Andreas Antonopoulos', 'It is no secret that most everyday consumers can barely scrape enough money together to pay for regular purchases.

Part of this trend can be attributed to the success of platforms such as MatchesFashion. However, there are other factors at play as well, as smartphone shopping is becoming an important aspect of e-commerce around the world these days.It is not easy to come by luxury items in the e-commerce space these days. Most of these items have price tags of four digits and more, making it a high-value target for credit card fraud and scammers. Imagine selling someone a US$3,000 watch online, only to see the transaction disputed by the issuing bank two weeks after the payment was made due to a fraudulent charge.That being said, there seems to be a market waiting to be explored by luxury retailers. Businesses brave enough to explore this niche market of e-commerce are most likely to see their sales numbers increase exponentially within the first year. Furthermore, growth will increase for many years to come, as there is very little competition in this market right now.Offering something special to customers looking to spend a fair amount of money will boost sales as well. Next-day delivery, for example, will be highly valued by customers, albeit it is not an option available everywhere in the world. Express delivery, regardless of the cost, is another alternative worth exploring.Luxury retailers can offer something most other online retailers can not: a different type of stock, especially where fashion is concerned. While there may be some overlapping with other e-commerce platforms, luxury retailers can carefully select their stock to put up for sale online, rather than just listing everything.Additionally, there are a lot of emerging designers in the fashion world who are chomping at the bit to get their creations advertised online. This gives luxury retailers another edge over their competitors. But despite all of these positive sides, there is still plenty of reason to stay cautious as well. Making a name for oneself in the luxury e-commerce sector will be a long and tough battle.Introducing Bitcoin Payments for Luxury Items?Retailers selling high-value brand goods in the e-commerce space can also differentiate themselves depending on which payment methods they accept. As previously mentioned, credit cards – as well as any online payment method using credit cards – are not the most secure solution. However, this is one of the most commonly used forms of payment around the world.Bitcoin is a more secure payment method, and has proven to be quite beneficial to the e-commerce sector as well. According to statistics provided in the past, Bitcoin customers spend more per purchase on average, making the luxury retail business an interesting opportunity to explore.What are your thoughts on using Bitcoin as a payment method in the luxury retail business?

12/27/2015,"[""About The AuthorDaniel is a bitcoin investor and journalist for numerous news outlets in the financial sector. When he's not writing, trading, or interviewing people, you can find him swimming, reading or taking one of his hobbies to the next level."", 'Dr. Peter R Rizun is a managing editor for Ledger— the first peer-reviewed academic journal dedicated to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency research. The deadline for submissions for Ledger\'s inaugural edition is 31st December, 2015.What a long, strange trip it’s been! Only four years ago, and two years after it started as a novelty in 2009, Reuben Grinberg published the first academic article on bitcoin, ""BitCoin: An Innovative Alternative Digital Currency,"" in the 2011 issue of the Hastings Science & Technology Law Journal.Since then, the pace of bitcoin research has accelerated to the point where it justifies its own peer-reviewed journal: Ledger.In this article, I present a ""Top 10"" list of research papers published in 2015. The editors at Ledger think of each of them as ""the one that got away"", because they represent the kind of research that the journal supports.While this list is by no means authoritative (and most certainly subjective), it reviews some of the year’s most influential papers, and presents several others that were praised in academic circles but received little exposure within the bitcoin community.We watch with excitement as increasing numbers of people begin to comprehend bitcoin’s potential ramifications on our future world, and we look forward in anticipation to the results from cryptocurrency work and discovery that will undoubtedly come in 2016.The list is a broad mix of papers from engineering, the sciences and economics that contributed to the nascent field of cryptocurrency research.10. SoK: Research Perspectives and Challenges for Bitcoin and CryptocurrenciesAuthors: Joseph Bonneau, Andrew Miller, Jeremy Clark, Arvind Narayanan, Joshua A. Kroll and Edward W Felten.Given bitcoin’s cypherpunk roots, its scattered documentation, and its lack of a formal specifications, Bonneau, Miller, Clark, Narayanan, Kroll and Felten complete the monumental tasks of producing the ""first systematic exposition of bitcoin"".Written in the form of a review article, the paper collects, organizes and synthesizes a huge body of prior work — from academic sources spanning three decades, to IRC logs, online discussion forums and developer mailing lists.They identify three components of bitcoin’s design that can be decoupled and analyzed individually: (1) transactions and scripts, (2) consensus and mining, and (3) the peer-to-peer communication network.They also speak to the mystery of how a quarter century of academics was unable to discover what (apparently) came intuitively to Satoshi Nakamoto.This is a must-read article for those interested in quickly getting up to speed on the current state of computer science research in cryptocurrency.9. Eclipse Attacks on Bitcoin’s Peer-to-Peer NetworkAuthors: Ethan Heilman, Alison Kendler, Aviv Zohar and Sharon Goldberg.Security researchers have been eager to identify new attack vectors against the bitcoin network since the authors of the ""selfish mining"" paper garnered praise and publicity in 2013.Presented in August during the 24th USENIX Security Symposium in Washington, DC, authors Heilman, Kendler, Zohar and Goldberg reveal the ""eclipse attack"", in which the attacker ""monopolizes all of the victim’s incoming and outgoing connections, thus isolating the victim from the rest of its peers in the network"".The attacker can then trick the victim by feeding him misinformation about the state of the ledger, or coopt the victim\'s computing power for its own nefarious purposes.8. Confidential TransactionsAuthor: Gregory MaxwellThat there is a strong desire for financial privacy in bitcoin comes as no surprise, given the community’s historically libertarian leanings. Possibly no one has made more of an impact fostering privacy-enhancing techniques than Gregory Maxwell.Following up on his 2013 invention of ""coinjoin"", in this report Maxwell presents his latest cutting-edge research. ""Confidential Transactions"" is a technique that permits users to hide the values of their payments from the public, yet — with novel cryptographic methods— present sufficient information to allow miners to verify that the sum of the coins transacted is preserved.Implementing confidential transactions in bitcoin requires significant protocol changes; however, experimentation is currently being carried out on Blockstream sidechains.7. Does Governance Have a Role in Pricing? Cross-Country Evidence from Bitcoin MarketsAuthor: Robert ViglioneIn this paper, PhD candidate Robert Viglione statistically proves an inverse relationship between economic freedom and bitcoin price premiums.His methodology represents a potential market-based — rather than expert-defined —measure of economic freedom that is updated in real time, rather than annually. This might provide us with data needed to run event studies that document the market’s perception of elections, for example.It also shows that even at this early, volatile stage, bitcoin is generating useful macroeconomic data.6. Bitcoin in Islamic Banking and FinanceAuthor: Charles W EvansConsidering that Muslims make up about 25% of the world’s population, and that bitcoin is free of interest, Professor Charles Evans argues that the overlap between hard-money advocacy and Shari\'a-compliant finance is large enough for these two communities to build intellectual bridges.This paper has put bitcoin on the radar of many people previously far-removed from cryptocurrency, resulting in a surprising amount of attention from Muslims worldwide.5. Bitcoin-NG: A Scalable Blockchain ProtocolAuthors: Ittay Eyal, Adem Efe Gencer, Emin Gun Sirer and Robbert van RenesseAs a follow-up to the influential 2013 manuscript on selfish mining, Cornell investigators Eyal, Gencer, Sirer and van Renesse do not disappoint.Bitcoin-NG is a radical scalability proposal that employs ""micro blocks"" and ""key blocks"" to bypass the tradeoff between transactional throughput and latency in bitcoin’s present peer-to-peer communication network.In addition to benchmarking the performance of their proposal using a large-scale bitcoin-network simulator, the authors also introduce several novel metrics such as consensus delay and mining power utilization for quantifying the security and efficiency of blockchain protocols.4. Digital CurrenciesAuthor: Bank of International Settlements, Committee on Payments and Market InfrastructuresIn its November report, this Bank of International Settlements committee recognized bitcoin’s distributed ledger technology (the Blockchain) as a ""genuinely innovative element within digital currency schemes"".The report states that such ledgers may offer lower costs to end users compared with existing centralized arrangements and that digital currencies such as bitcoin might address gaps in traditional payment services.3. Should Cryptocurrencies be Included in the Portfolio of the International Reserves Held by the Central Bank of Barbados?Authors: Winston Moore and Jeremy StephenIn this working paper from the Central Bank of Barbados, economists Winston Moore and Jeremy Stephen conclude that holding a small portion of reserve assets in bitcoin could be beneficial to the small island nation.The appropriate portfolio allocation could both improve returns and increase diversity against speculative attacks, without significantly affecting the volatility of the reserve balance.The authors recognize that ""digital currency could become a key currency for settling transactions"" and that it is necessary for central banks to evaluate their potential impact.This paper is significant because it reveals the emerging worldwide recognition of bitcoin as a useful store of value among central bank authorities.2. The Bitcoin Backbone ProtocolAuthors: Juan A Garay, Aggelos Kiayias and Nikos LeonardosAlready with 24 citations attesting to its impact, ""The Bitcoin Backbone Protocol"" provides one of the first ""provable security"" models for a cryptocurrency\'s consensus algorithm.Authors Garay, Kiayias and Leonardos ""extract and analyze the core of the Bitcoin protocol,"" framing their analysis in terms of two novel properties they refer to as common prefix and chain quality.The common prefix property relates to the network’s ability to converge upon a single history, while the chain quality property describes the degree to which a malicious entity can gain an advantage in excess of its mining power.Their results align with those from Eyal and Sirer (selfish mining) and in fact broadly generalize the underlying concepts.1. The Bitcoin Lightning Network: Scalable Off-Chain Instant PaymentsAuthors: Joseph Poon and Thaddeus DryjaIn perhaps the most influential paper of 2015, Poon and Dryja present their invention: the Bitcoin Lightning Network, which is an extension of two-party payment channels applied in such a way as to permit instant transactions between any number of participants.Lightning transactions are normal bitcoin transactions, but— except for rare cases — are not actually posted to the Blockchain. Because the bulk of the transactional data is stored privately, lightning transactions are expected to be significantly less expensive than on-chain bitcoin transactions, thereby enabling affordable micropayments.Poon and Dryja’s vision may soon be realized, as Blockstream continues to work towards making the Lightning Network a reality.Research paper image via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Alford, who first uncovered the identity of Silk Road boss Ross Ulbricht using Google searches.By the middle of 2013, Ulbricht had built Silk Road into a “dark web” marketplace that facilitated the sale of enormous amounts of contraband, including $300,000 in heroin per day, according to The New York Times .And though multiple government agencies, including the FBI, were on the hunt for Ulbricht, they didn’t know his name, only his moniker: “Dread Pirate Roberts.”Alford, an IRS agent who had been assigned to work with the DEA on the case, was the one to finally solve the puzzle of Ulbricht's identity.How did he do it?“I’m not high-tech, but I’m like, ‘This isn’t that complicated. This is just some guy behind a computer,’” Alford had said to himself, according to The New York Times. “In these technical investigations, people think they are too good to do the stupid old-school stuff. But I’m like, ‘Well, that stuff still works.’” So he decided to use old-school tactics.What ended up finally working was a fairly simple Google search. Alford used “advanced search” on Google to look for content posted between certain dates. That method led him, in late May 2013, to a chat room post by someone named “altoid,” that was created right before the Silk Road went online.“Has anyone seen Silk Road yet?” altoid asked, according to The New York Times. “It’s kind of like an anonymous Amazon.com .”Because the post was so early, Alford suspected it must have come from someone involved in Silk Road. And when he looked through all of altoid’s posts, Alford came across a post that had been deleted, but that showed up in the thread of another user's reply.In that post, Altoid had given an email address: rossulbricht@gmail.com.From there, all that remained was searching on Google for Ross Ulbricht. Alford discovered he was a guy from Texas who had suspicious overlapping interests with Dread Pirate Roberts. In particular, a love of certain free-market and libertarian thinkers. Bingo.Alford was ecstatic when he brought his bosses a name and location for a man who turned out to be Dread Pirate Roberts. The problem? His bosses didn’t immediately listen, and brushed him off.But Alford didn’t give up on the Ulbricht lead, and eventually uncovered more information that helped capture Ulbricht and bring down Silk Road, though the work of the FBI and other agencies was also instrumental.You can read Alford’s full story at The New York Times ."", 'Se ha comentado sobre la posibilidad de que un nuevo chip de minería se haya conectado a la red con una velocidad de procesamiento mucho mayor que los que se encuentran actualmente en el mercado.

The deadline for submissions for Ledger\'s inaugural edition is 31st December, 2015.What a long, strange trip it’s been! Only four years ago, and two years after it started as a novelty in 2009, Reuben Grinberg published the first academic article on bitcoin, ""BitCoin: An Innovative Alternative Digital Currency,"" in the 2011 issue of the Hastings Science & Technology Law Journal.Since then, the pace of bitcoin research has accelerated to the point where it justifies its own peer-reviewed journal: Ledger.In this article, I present a ""Top 10"" list of research papers published in 2015. The editors at Ledger think of each of them as ""the one that got away"", because they represent the kind of research that the journal supports.While this list is by no means authoritative (and most certainly subjective), it reviews some of the year’s most influential papers, and presents several others that were praised in academic circles but received little exposure within the bitcoin community.We watch with excitement as increasing numbers of people begin to comprehend bitcoin’s potential ramifications on our future world, and we look forward in anticipation to the results from cryptocurrency work and discovery that will undoubtedly come in 2016.The list is a broad mix of papers from engineering, the sciences and economics that contributed to the nascent field of cryptocurrency research.10.

12/31/2015,"['Nasdaq has trumpeted a recent share transaction as the first-ever private securities issuance documented with a blockchain, the technology that underpins crypto-currencies like bitcoin.The exchange announced on Dec. 30 that it used its blockchain-powered platform, Linq, to allow a startup called Chain to sell shares to an unnamed private technology investor in the US.But the Linq transaction looks like a bit of PR-posturing from the exchange. For starters, it probably isn’t the first time a company’s share transactions were recorded on a blockchain. As the Financial Times pointed out, Symbiont, a startup backed by former New York Stock Exchange chief executive Duncan Niederauer, issued its own shares on the bitcoin blockchain on Aug. 4.In September, Digital Asset Holdings, led by former JPMorgan bigwig Blythe Masters, also used blockchain tech to enable a startup called Pivit to distribute shares to investors. Nasdaq is unfazed by these precedents. “This is the first-ever private securities issuance documented with blockchain technology and we stand by this view,” Nasdaq spokesman Ryan Wells told Quartz.Blockchains promise to cut out a lot of the administrative costs and paperwork that’s currently required when private companies want to distribute shares. That’s because a blockchain is a shared ledger that all the parties in a transaction maintain, which cuts out the need for manual work, like mailing paper-share certificates and updating individual ledgers. That’s why so many firms are experimenting with the technology’s potential to sharply reduce securities settlement times.But there’s a bit more bluster to cut through in Nasdaq’s claim. Chain, the company that sold its shares, is also the technology vendor that helped build the Linq platform. This isn’t mentioned in Nasdaq’s latest release, although it was announced in June. “Chain is a blockchain developer and worked hand-in-hand with Nasdaq as we created the technology,” Wells said.Nasdaq’s blockchain transaction, then, is starting to look more like a technology vendor testing its product and less like a milestone on the road to a financial technology revolution.', 'It\'s been another formative year in the world of bitcoin and the blockchain, and while the price has been subdued over much of the year, other developments in the space have arguably been more intriguing than in any 12-month period previously.We\'ve seen companies come and go, record-setting funding rounds, increased interest in the technology and, sadly, occasional bad actors still stirring negativity into the mix.In this year-end special, we look back at the news stories that made the most impact during 2015.1. Bitstamp Claims $5 Million Lost in Hot Wallet HackThe year got off to a shocking start on 5th January when bitcoin exchange Bitstamp released a statement admitting that it had suffered a major hack and lost ""less than 19,000 BTC"", or about $5.1m at the time.In a statement, Bitstamp said an undisclosed number of wallets had been compromised, and that upon learning of the breach, it had issued warnings to users and moved to suspend operations.A report, supposedly leaked from the exchange, later suggested that six Bitstamp employees had been targeted over some weeks in a phishing attempt that led to the theft. Eventually, the hackers were able to access two servers containing the file for Bitstamp’s hot wallet and it passphrase.Following the attack, the exchange put in place multi-sig wallet access and contracted bitcoin security firm Xapo to handle its cold wallet storage.However, the incident still served to set the tone for what would be a bleak first half of the year for the industry as a whole, particularly for exchanges, which struggled to find revenues amid increased competition and lower-than-expected user adoption.2. Megabank Joins Coinbase\'s Record $75 Million Funding RoundLater in January, wallet and exchange provider Coinbase announced that it had raised $75m as part of a Series C funding round – smashing the previous record for a bitcoin company.Asides from the figures, the backers were equally impressive.The round included a host of impressive first-time bitcoin investors including the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Fortune 500 financial services group USAA, Spanish megabank BBVA and Japanese telcom giant DoCoMo. Former Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit and former Thomson Reuters CEO Tom Glocer also contributed personal investments.Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong suggested at the time that the funding would help shift the mainstream perception of bitcoin during what had so far been a rocky year for the industry.Armstrong told CoinDesk:""I think this just really changes the conversation. There’s smart money out there that is betting big on this and is totally unphased by the whims of the price and what the market is doing. They’re much more concerned about the fundamentals of what’s happening in the network ... and across those metrics, everything is looking great.""While the fundamentals of the network would continue to be debated, Armstrong was on the money with his prediction about funding, with the round serving as the opening salvo for what would be a year marked by a substantial increase in interest from financial incumbents.3. Bitcoin Startup 21 Announces $116 Million All-Star BackingThe Wall Street Journal published a scoop in March, revealing that stealth startup 21 Inc had raised $116m in funding, a figure that served to put Coinbase\'s $75m January round, at least temporarily, in the shade.21 Inc\'s then-CEO Matthew Pauker indicated at the time that Andreessen Horowitz, Data Collective, Khosla Ventures, RRE Ventures and Yuan Capital were among the firms that invested in the company.Qualcomm Ventures also participated, as did Dropbox CEO Drew Houston and Zynga co-founder Mark Pincus.What many missed in all the excitement, however, was that the impressive figure had been raised over multiple funding rounds dating back likely as far as 2013.The news was all the more mysterious since the California-based company was still not yet publicizing its business plans.Observers at the time said chip-maker Qualcomm\'s involvement was a likely sign that mobile technologies could be at the heart of 21\'s endeavour, but the big reveal was to come later in the year.4. Former JP Morgan Exec Blythe Masters Swaps Wall Street for BitcoinMarch brought further interesting news, when former JP Morgan exec Blythe Masters took a chief executive role at bitcoin trading platform Digital Assets Holdings (DA).In a statement to the Wall Street Journal, the commodities veteran suggested that blockchain technology could restore confidence and trust in the financial markets, sentiments that would soon find her becoming the veritable figurehead for the rising interest use cases for bitcoin\'s distributed ledger, the blockchain.Masters, who had previously been head of global commodities at JP Morgan Chase, told the WSJ at the time:""Digital Assets has a revolutionary technology platform that eliminates the counterparty risk and lack of transparency that has hindered mainstream adoption of cryptographic technology. The possibilities for reducing cost and risk in settlement are enormous.""In the months since, Masters has become known for her work promoting blockchain tech to Wall Street execs, and has turned down an offer from Barclays to stay at DA.Still, it was ultimately a mixed year for the DA team, with reports asserting the startup is struggling to raise funding while criticizing the strength of its technical product.5. Former White House Advisor to Head MIT Digital Currency InitiativeApril saw MIT Media Lab announce the launch of Digital Currency Initiative, a three-pronged program aimed at increasing awareness of the technology on campus while providing research to promote policy and standards initiatives.The news was embellished by the fact that it was to be led by former White House senior advisor Brian Forde, who had previously worked with the administration of President Barack Obama.Forde explained at the time how the Digital Currency Initiative would seek to address questions regarding the technology\'s security, scalability and privacy, while convening governments and nonprofits ""to research and test concepts"" related to its use.Soon after, Bitcoin Core developers Gavin Andresen, Wladimir van der Laan and Cory Fields joined the project, at a time when their previous financial supporter, the Bitcoin Foundation, was undergoing financial difficulties.Brian Forde said the move would help bring stability to development team, something he suggested had been lacking in recent years as the foundation had been rocked by scandals.6. Nasdaq Becomes Latest Firm to Trial Blockchain TechnologyLater in April, global stock market giant Nasdaq went public with its explorations into how a blockchain solutions could change the way shares are transferred and sold.While Nasdaq was simply ""the latest"" big financial group to advertise its interest at the time, it would soon become the most prolific in terms of stoking public interest in its blockchain R&D.The company would later reveal it was trialling the technology in Nasdaq Private Market, a capital marketplace launched in January 2014, eventually debuting the proof-of-concept at Money 20/20 in November of that year.In subsequent interviews, Nasdaq has hinted that it is exploring more use cases for the technology and that its interest is only in its infancy.This enthusiasm also appears to be present throughout the organization, with Nasdaq chief executive Robert Greifeld even telling The Wall Street Journal:""Utilising the blockchain is a natural digital evolution for managing physical securities.""7. Silk Road Operator Ross Ulbricht Sentenced to Life in PrisonOn 29th May, Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the operation of Silk Road, the now-defunct online dark market.The sentence was handed down by US District Judge Katherine Forrest in New York, capping roughly a year and a half-long legal process that saw multiple bitcoin auctions and the shock indictment of two federal agents involved in the investigation.In addition to the prison term, Ulbricht was ordered to pay $183.9m to the federal government, an amount tied to proceeds related to the operation of Silk Road.Ulbricht, who ran the marketplace under the name Dread Pirate Roberts, was convicted in February on seven charges related to narcotics distribution, computer hacking and conspiracy.The severity of the sentencing quickly set off a firestorm of comment and criticism, with debates centering on the alleged hypocrisy of the federal government and the morality of its handling of illicit Internet crime in context of its actions against the traditional financial sector.Such criticisms, however, were interspersed with live drama, as standing outside of a New York courthouse, Lyn Ulbricht voiced concern for her son Ross Ulbricht’s safety as he left for a maximum security prison.8. Is Greece Really Behind Bitcoin\'s Latest Price Surge?After months of relative calm, the price of bitcoin spiked to a relative high of $257 on 17th June.Some in the community sought to tie the market movement to the fact that that Greece was, at the time, likely to default on its debt obligations and exit the eurozone (the \'Grexit\' as it had been dubbed).The international press seized on the claims, but were the two actually linked?The narrative was not a new one for the bitcoin space, given that digital currencies are one of the few assets that can act as a hedge against fiat currency fluctuation. Similarly, many in the bitcoin community had correlated the rising interest in bitcoin in 2013 with severe economic issues in Cyprus, past precedent that gave momentum to the theory.However, many prominent members of the bitcoin space had doubts that any real links existed between the two situations, and that Greeks were unlikely to turn to bitcoin as a safe-haven asset.UK Digital Currency Association board member Paul Gordon suggested at the time, while a convenient narrative, there was little evidence to suggest the timing was anything but coincidental or that activity in Greece is actually at the root of the movement.Others startups took advantage of the attention, with firms like Coinbase seeking to advertise their services more intently to Greek users.9. New York Releases Final BitLicenseAfter more than a year of waiting, the bitcoin and blockchain industry finally saw the passage of the first state-specific licensing regime for digital currencies in June.The long-controversial regulation was nonetheless heralded as a major milestone among major financial news outlets, one that precipitated a slew of other important developments.Soon after, bitcoin exchanges itBit and Gemini launched services in New York, though they did so with banking charters rather than BitLicenses. Later, Circle Internet Financial secured what has been to date, the only license issued in the state.Elsewhere, there was a predictable series of events with bitcoin companies pulling out of New York, blaming the costs of compliance.Since then, technology advocates have continued to argue the law was still too restrictive for a nascent industry, prompting other US states to take different paths to regulating the industry.Following its passage, California and North Carolina have both started, and shelved, plans to introduce similar measures.10. Bitcoin \'Forked\' in Controversial Bid to Resolve Scalability QuestionMid-August saw a controversial attempt to resolve the fiery bitcoin scalability debate, when two of bitcoin\'s best-known developers – Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn – \'forked\' a version of the software that helps run the network.The changes to Bitcoin XT (a patch that sits over Bitcoin Core) were written as a way to \'opt out\' of bitcoin\'s 1MB block size limit, which currently limits the number of transactions that can be processed by the digital currency\'s mining network roughly every 10 minutes.Without change, the network can handle around 3-7 transactions per second on a sustained basis, and the average by mid-June had been 1.2 t/s. However, that\'s not to say there wasn\'t impetus for action.Impromptu stress tests had demonstrated that by overloading the network with high numbers of transactions, it was possible to cause significant delays in transaction confirmation.Reaching the so-called \'capacity cliff\' (when transactions exceed the capacity of the network) could either create a competitive market for transaction fees or destroy the robustness of the network completely, depending on who you ask.Increasing bitcoin\'s block size – a \'quick fix\' for the issue – carries its own long-term implications for the network, which some argued would make the network more centralised and, thus, less trusted.While anyone can run XT, the new rules will only be triggered when 75% of bitcoin miners have done so. In effect, it was a novel way to let people actually using and supporting the network vote on the matter.There were numerous critics of the changes, however. Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd, for one, said at the time that the standard 95% threshold for soft-forks was chosen for good safety engineering reasons, and that 75% was ""very low"".Pieter Wuille, another Core developer, told CoinDesk he also had concerns:""People not being able to send coins from one \'side\' of the fork to another, and all coins that existed before the fork being able to be spent twice (once on every side of the fork) [is] the very thing that bitcoin was designed to prevent.""\'Theymos\', moderator of Reddit\'s r/bitcoin forum, even banned talk of XT claiming that as a fork of Bitcoin Core, XT should be classed as an \'altcoin\' or a \'forkcoin\', similar to litecoin.11. Visa, Capital One Back $30 Million Round for Blockchain Startup ChainOn 9th September, startup Chain announced it had raised $30m in new funding from investors including Visa, Capital One and Fiserv – an impressive figure that revealed the growing recognition of the advantages of blockchain technology.French telecom giant Orange SA contributed to the round, as did Nasdaq, which has been working with Chain, and Citi Ventures.The funding all but cemented Chain as the company to watch in the industry, as it had seemingly found a viable business model at a time when many startups were struggling to earn revenues amid declining interest in bitcoin trading.Chain would go on to debut four proofs-of-concept at big-box financial conference Money 20/20, all but stealing the show from its competition.12. Inside R3CEV\'s Plot to Bring Distributed Ledgers to Wall StreetFirst outed by CoinDesk for its ambitions to build a blockchain consortium in July, it was tough at first to tell how successful R3 would be at enlisting enterprise organizations in its work.Was it an R&D workshop? A consultancy? Or would it be offering a product of its own? While R3\'s exact strategy is still a bit unclear, what\'s not is that it will have tremendous support from financial incumbents.The turn of the tide came in mid-September nine major investment banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, partnered with the startup. Many on the list had previously announced independent efforts to study blockchain tech, and the banks were said to be investing money in R3 as part of the effort.Late September saw 13 more banks sign up – including Citi, HSBC and Bank of America Chase – followed by BNP Paribas, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, ING, MacQuarie and Wells Fargo in November, and another 12 in December that included Banco Santander.In total, R3 now says 42 of the world\'s banks have joined the group.13. Amazon Starts Shipping 21 Bitcoin ComputersThe mysterious and extremely well-funded bitcoin startup 21 Inc made an official announcement for its upcoming bitcoin product in May, stating at the time that its market strategy would focus on distributing bitcoin mining chips embedded in consumer and enterprise hardware devices.However, it wasn\'t until late September that it finally started accepting pre-orders for an actual consumer device – the 21 Bitcoin Computer – and 16th November that it actually went on general sale on Amazon.Retailing for $399.99, the 21 Bitcoin Computer includes a custom mining chip, a datacenter backend and a custom Linux-based operating system.The firm made it clear that it did not intend for its units, which contribute to transaction processing on the bitcoin blockchain, to be tools for speculative bitcoin mining. Instead, the units were aimed to provide a ""stream of bitcoins"" for use in apps and services.21 Inc, however, struggled somewhat to communicate the product\'s advantages even to its target consumers in the development community, and as of the end of 2015, seemed intent on relying on word-of-mouth advertising to propel its project rather than more expensive or articulate advertising campaigns.14. Reports Claim Satoshi Nakamoto Might Be 44-Year-Old AustralianReports from Wired and Gizmodo on the 9th December shocked the bitcoin world with claims that they had possibly identified the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, as Australian entrepreneur Craig S Wright.Dave Kleiman, a US computer forensics expert who passed away in 2013, was also said to have been significantly involved in the development of the digital currency.According to Wright\'s LinkedIn account, he has worked with a series of companies including Hotwire Pre-Emptive Intelligence Group – the firm behind an effort to create a bitcoin-based bank called Denariuz and later ran into problems with the Australian Tax Office.In its exposé, Wired cited ""an anonymous source close to Wright"" who provided a cache of emails, transcripts and other documents that pointed to Wright\'s role in the creation of bitcoin.Gizmodo, meanwhile, said it had been provided with a cache of documents, which it had corroborated in interviews, from someone claiming to have hacked Wright’s business email account.Wired presented its evidence with caution, raising the possibility that the information might have been fabricated – perhaps even by Wright himself, and other news outlets soon began picking apart the story\'s inconsistencies.Still, the idea that the Wright \'revelations\' are nothing but a hoax has been aired by other observers, though the compelling nature of the published evidence will no doubt fuel speculation for some time to come.What were your biggest stories of 2015?

In 2014, The Guardian reported that America is ‘a decade behind Europe’ in terms of adopting the chip and pin cards that have reduced data theft, due to the former’s strict regulatory rules. Today, European countries, especially the Netherlands, are keen to adopt the latest fintech.In this post, we want to highlight the latest payment and financial technologies implemented by banks and businesses in the Netherlands.Contact and contactless machinesAccording to the information shared by Worldpay, countertop payment terminals remain the ‘most widely used payment method’ by most businesses and retailers worldwide. These machines are also able to accept contactless payments that reduce customer waiting time as well as process requests faster and more secure.Apart from the countertop machines, here are the other kinds of card machines that businesses leverage:1. Portable card machines2. Mobile card machines3. Contactless paymentsBitcoin and cryptocurrenciesIn June 2015, Cryptocoinnews reported about International Monetary Fund (IMF) Director Christine Lagarde’s thoughts on Bitcoin and its groundbreaking technology. Lagarde said that banks and financial institutions shouldn’t worry about Bitcoin, Blockchain, and other cryptocurrencies – rather they should challenge them to strengthen their security processes, to offer people the most secure and fastest peer-to-peer currency exchange. Three Dutch banks (ING, ABN Amro, and Rabobank) have already announced that they are experimenting with Bitcoin and its technology as a way to improve their payment systems. But, many banks and financial organizations remain cautious when it comes to accepting the cryptocurreny as issues regarding its security remain a hotly debated topic.Voice-activated online bankingWe all know what Siri can do, but now a Dutch bank has announced their latest innovation for online banking that allows users to access their digital bank accounts through voice activation. ING Netherlands released their new mobile banking app that comes with voice-activated log-in to fight banking fraud. In a featured post from the Daily Mail, the same application will also have an option to use the fingerprint recognition (Touch ID) on Apple devices.“Thanks in part to the inclusion of biometric applications, we are able to make banking faster, smoother and easier for our customers and improve access,” said ING internet & mobile marketing manager Jeroen Losekoot. “This allows them to have greater control over their finances.”The Netherlands remains one of the top adopters of financial technologies, not only in Europe but also across the world. New fintech innovations are set to initiate huge developments in the financial industry. What other financial technologies do you expect to see next year?Photo Credit: antanacoins via Compfight cc', 'Trögt i porten för insektsmatInsekter må vara framtidens föda – men de är fortfarande sällsynta på tallrikarna. Sedan vi skrev om saken i våras har myndigheterna stängt två nätbutiker, varav en i Göteborg.Det har talats mycket om insekter som proteinkälla, inte minst sedan FN-rapport 2013 pekade ut dem som en lösning på hungerproblemen. Men det är fortfarande förbjudet att sälja insekter som människoföda i Sverige och de flesta EU-länder.På sensommaren stoppade miljöförvaltningen i Göteborg firman Hakuna mat, som sålde bland annat mjölmask och gräshoppor. En planerad provsmakning vid Malmöfestivalen ställdes också in. Någon månad senare tvingades företaget Qvicket i Stockholm sluta sälja mjöl och knäckebröd tillverkade av malda syrsor.Nya regler kan vara på väg, säger Zofia Kurowska, statsinspektör vid Livsmedelsverket.- Det som har hänt senast är att Efsa (EU:s livsmedelsmyndighet) har kommit med en riskprofil om insekter. De har rett ut vilka risker som finns när det gäller till exempel allergier, hygien och miljö. Sedan följer vi noga ett ärende i Frankrike där ett företag kommer att ansöka om att få producera sådan mat.Här i Sverige har ovan nämnda Qvicket sökt tillstånd att få sälja sina insektsvaror. Beslutet ser dock ut att dröja.- Vi behöver nya riktlinjer från Efsa, de kan komma nästa sommar. Vår uppgift är att konsumenterna ska få säker mat. Vi godkänner inte någonting förhastat, säger Zofia Kurowska.Dryga böter hotar tandborstbolagMyndigheterna tar i med hårdhandskarna mot INT förbrukningsartiklar, det lilla företaget i Jönköping som har varit en av årets värsta konsumentplågor. Nu hotar mångmiljonböter.Firman drivs av en 24-årig man i Jönköping som säljer tandborstar under namnet Dental clean och nyckelbrickor under namnet Nyckelhittaren Jönköping. Vi skrev om honom i augusti – hans då helt nystartade verksamhet toppade listan över sommarens mest KO-anmälda bolag.Sedan dess har klagomålen fortsatt. Ett stort antal kunder berättar om falska löften och räkningar som anlänt utan att de beställt något, ibland utan att de ens talat med företaget. Firman har fått 106 KO-anmälningar samt minst 120 polisanmälningar sedan i juni.I november stämde Konsumentombudsmannen bolaget i tingsrätten. I december kom ett interimistiskt beslut, där INT förbrukningsartiklar och dess ägare förbjuds att vilseleda kunderna vid vite av upp till fyra miljoner kronor per vecka. Bolaget åläggs att informera om säljsamtalens syfte, om att deras ""gratiserbjudanden"" är kopplade till abonnemang samt om ångerrätten. Dessutom måste de genast sluta skicka ut obeställda varor.- Så kallade löpande viten är något som vi yrkar vid de grövsta överträdelserna, företag som fortsätter med otillbörliga metoder trots tidigare uppmaningar, säger Gunnar Wikström som är processråd hos KO.Samtidigt utreds polisanmälningarna av bedrägeriroteln i Jönköping. Det är ännu oklart om 24-åringen kommer att åtalas.- Det är dumheter han håller på med. Människor har blivit lurade. Frågan är om det går att styrka brottsligt uppsåt, säger förundersökningsledaren Niclas Abrahamsson.24-åringen har tidigare skyllt överträdelserna på sina före detta anställda och har uppgivit att företaget ""växte för fort"". När konsumentredaktionen ringde upp honom höstas lade han på luren.Inga spår efter Iphone-skojarenI augusti betalade den 37-årige göteborgaren Markus 4 500 kronor för en Iphone 6 som visade sig vara en plastkopia. Polisen har inte hittat bedragaren.- Det har inte hänt något. Polisen verkar inte komma någon vart, säger han.Bluffen var grundligt genomförd med Blocket-annons, förfalskat kvitto, inplastad kartong och falskt IMEI-nummer (mobilens unika id-nummer). För Markus sved det extra mycket eftersom telefonen var en 60-årspresent till hans mamma.- Besvikelsen lagt sig men den finns kvar. Jag försöker att inte tänka på det. Jag lärde mig en läxa men den var inte billig, säger han.Denna sorts bedrägerier har varit vanliga under året. Polisens råd är att helst inte köpa mobiler privat och, om man ändå gör det, att bryta förpackningen på plats och kontrollera produkten.I oktober dömdes en 23-årig Malmöbo för mer än 50 Iphone-bedrägerier runt om i Sverige, bland annat i Göteborg, Kungälv och Halmstad. Tillvägagångssättet var till stora delar likadant men 23-åringen har inte kunnat kopplas till bedrägeriet mot Markus.Nya stämningar mot bitcoinbolagKunderna som känner sig lurade av bitcoinbolaget KNC miner fick inget stöd av Allmänna reklamationsnämnden. Nu väntar rättegång.Företaget sålde dyra specialdatorer (cirka 80 000 kronor styck) som skulle användas för att utvinna bitcoin och andra digitala valutor. Maskinerna blev kraftigt försenade, ibland var de trasiga eller kom aldrig överhuvudtaget. KNC Miner vägrade ersätta kunderna.Ett 40-tal personer vände sig till ARN. Nu har nämnden avvisat anmälningarna – inte för att bolaget gjorde rätt, utan för att den som utvinner bitcoin räknas som företagare och därför inte kan få sin tvist prövad hos ARN.En av anmälarna är en 31-årig göteborgare som vi intervjuade i våras. Han betalade 81 000 kronor för en maskin som kom en och en halv månad efter utlovad tid. 31-åringen ville häva köpet, dels på grund av förseningen och dels för att flera likadana maskiner börjat brinna.- Beskedet från ARN överraskade mig. Jag trodde det skulle bli ett annat beslut. Jag har inte bestämt hur jag ska gå vidare, säger han i dag.Samtidigt har 54 personer stämt företaget i tingsrätten för att få sina pengar tillbaka. Antalet kommer att öka, uppger deras advokat Magnus Daar.- Inom kort lämnar vi in en ny grupptalan mot KNC Miner med ett 50-tal svenska och utländska deltagare.Företagets vd Sam Cole hävdar i ett mejl till konsumentredaktionen att ""vi har uppfyllt vad vi lovat i fråga om leveranstider"" och att ""vissa av våra kunder har varit ute efter att göra snabba klipp"". Han förnekar att datorerna skulle vara brandfarliga.KNC Miner säljer inte längre datorer men driver en serverhall i Boden. Bolaget gick med stor förlust under andra halvåret 2014; resultatet var minus 66 miljoner kronor på en omsättning av 194 miljoner.', 'DECENT is an autonomous decentralized system owned by its users. The DECENT platform allows media sharing by guaranteeing to its users the right to freely express themselves. Matej Michalko, the Startup’s Co-founder and CEO says the company’s end goal is to give access to borderless data and information streams while maintaining a strategic distance from control, restriction or any outsider impact.DECENT created a distributed and secure publishing platform to allow users to freely and anonymously share their content while being able to monetize it. DECENT is liberating the world of media by enabling decentralized sharing of digital content. The project’s aim is to eliminate all political and geographical barriers so that people around the world can freely express themselves without any restrictions.The DECENT platform is anonymous; all the players are identified exclusively by their ID and protected by advanced cryptography. However, the users also have the option to be associated with given content. Focused on freedom of speech and expression, the platform provides unlimited access to information for everyone in the world.DECENT provides open-source software that enables users to share unlimited virtual content; the company’s main goal is to give a chance to individuals whose voice is normally controlled. DECENT combines a micropayment framework with solid encryption, giving a whole new level of privacy to its users—the DECENT platform only allows for authorized users to access the content. The platform operates via a P2P network, and DECENT’s platform is not centrally hosted, so the data cannot be manipulated and they can never be blocked.NewsBTC had a meeting with Matej Michalko, one of the company’s co-founders and CEO, where he was more than happy to tell us all about DECENT.NewsBTC – DECENT is introducing a new decentralized and anonymous P2P platform that allows users to freely share their content without any restrictions. What can you tell us about DECENT, and how did you come up with the idea for this new Platform?Matej – I’ve been familiar with Bitcoin since 2012. I have been a miner since 2012 and have organized bitcoin and cryptocurrency conferences all over the world. I’m the founder of BitcoinExpo and Bitcoin 2 Business Congress series, that had its chapters twice in London, Vienna, Shanghai, and Brussels. I also founded the first Crypto Digital Marketing Agency – BitcoinMarkerting in the world helping new cryptocurrency companies to get to the market.Hence, I understand the immense potential the Blockchain technology has; it can be applied to many different domains. I also observed that the world of media is dominated by oligopolies of big players and that there is a lack of free publishing platforms that would transform the current market dominated by oligopolies into a perfectly competitive one. Currently, the biggest players on the market charge about 60% for e-book distribution.The poor writers have only about 40% of the amount their readers pay. For instance, if they sell 10,000 books worth $20 each, they get only $80,000 instead of the $200,000 they could have when publishing with DECENT. There was a market need for a free P2P digital content distribution platform: all for the benefits of authors (writers, bloggers, musicians, video makers, …) and content consumers (readers, listeners, viewers, …).NewsBTC – What can you tell us about the DECENT team?Matej – I co-founded DECENT with Matej Boda, who was cooperating with me on the BitcoinExpo series. Moreover, our team consists of ex-Ericsson architect Josef Sevcik and well-known blockchain cryptographer Pavel Kravchenko. Our online presence is secured thanks to Martin Polacek and Sandra Wantrubova, and our Europe office is up and running thanks to Jana P. Bodova. We have secured a decent presence in China, mainly thanks to Xiaomin Wang and Weiwu Zhang.NewsBTC – What can you tell us about the company roadmap, aims and goals?Matej – The DECENT Protocol is developed and maintained by a Swiss-based foundation. The roadmap for 2016 is the following:We are planning a crowdsale of DECENT in Q1 2016 for the financing of the development and initial distribution of DCT tokens that will power the network.So far, there is a prototype with an API and a proof of concept available, that will be described soon in a video published at DECENT. Besides developing DECENT’s core, we are planning to make a lot of updates including security fixes and many other developments.NewsBTC – Can you tell us all about the platform, and how does it work?Matej – DECENT was designed with principles of functional decomposition. We have developed three independent layers, each serving specific functions:The data distribution layer, which is used for storing and sharing huge amounts of user-generated content. The blockchain, where all the transactions and contracts happen in a publicly verifiable manner. Also, the blockchain is used for storing permanent data. Those are buying transactions, publishing transactions, ratings, etc.And the recommendation layer, which consists of a set of independent recommendation engines, helping the consumer to select the most relevant content. From a user’s perspective, there are three roles the user can have:The Author—the author creates new content and publishes it on the network.The Content Consumer—the Content Consumer reads, watches, listens or otherwise consumes the content created by the authors.The Publisher and Miner. The publisher plays a vital role in the network: the publisher stores the content created by the author and distributes it to the consumers. The miner verifies the transactions and realizes payment distribution, and therefore is responsible for the consistency of the network.The interaction and flow principles are as follows:Authors can set the price for the content. Only users who paid the price set by the author can access the content. On the other hand, the payment will be processed only if the user verifiably received the content.The Author pays the Publisher for acting as a storage and content distribution network. The payment will be released over time to motivate the publisher to keep the content as long as required. The payment for network storage is also an effective anti-spam mechanism.Consumers can rate the content. These ratings can be used for various purposes, e.g. assuming content quality, author’s reputation or by recommendation engines. 100% of the payment for the content goes to the author. There are no network or processing fees. The Author and Consumer can remain fully anonymous if they want to.NewsBTC – Do you have any partnerships?Matej – We have partnerships with a few corporations that are going to build their own platforms or integrate it into their existing services, but I can’t disclose that information for now!NewsBTC – Can you comment about the company’s investors or what type of investors DECENT was able to find?Matej – We had: US/Chinese/Malaysian VC funds (seed investment); they invest into blockchain-based applications as they believe this will be the future of the world. The blockchain will replace many services that work well today—remember, Uber is a middleman. They take 20% fees.NewsBTC – How do you see or what is your vision about BTC and the blockchain’s significance to freedom of speech?Matej – The blockchain is decentralized trust. Most of the people need some sort of a third party to refer to, such as their grocery, transporter, the one they work for, etc. Since the early days, centralization has been a major competitive advantage: the media has been controlled and manipulated by monopolies and oligopolies that pushed the market advantage to make profits in detriment of authors and readers.The advent of the internet did not help much to get rid of centralization in order to move to more competitive markets; the blockchain meant a revolution in this paradigm. For the first time, people are able to use a fully competitive market for digital content, where 100% of the revenue paid by readers goes to the authors in order to put money where it should be on behalf of everyone but greedy monopolists and oligopolists.NewsBTC – What are your prospects and expectations for the future of the DECENT platform?Matej – We are hoping that within five years we will become the main publishing protocol worldwide. Get more developers and integrating into more existing content distribution protocol and platforms. Save time, money and create new, better, fully competitive markets.NewsBTC – What are your expectations for the future of Bitcoin and digital currencies?Matej – I believe that more and more services are going to be replaced by blockchain-based ones, such as notary public, money transfers, e-governments, etc. I believe both Bitcoin and blockchain technology have a bright future ahead.You can watch a description in the official DECENT video:']","['Nasdaq has trumpeted a recent share transaction as the first-ever private securities issuance documented with a blockchain, the technology that underpins crypto-currencies like bitcoin.The exchange announced on Dec. 30 that it used its blockchain-powered platform, Linq, to allow a startup called Chain to sell shares to an unnamed private technology investor in the US.But the Linq transaction looks like a bit of PR-posturing from the exchange. For starters, it probably isn’t the first time a company’s share transactions were recorded on a blockchain. As the Financial Times pointed out, Symbiont, a startup backed by former New York Stock Exchange chief executive Duncan Niederauer, issued its own shares on the bitcoin blockchain on Aug. 4.In September, Digital Asset Holdings, led by former JPMorgan bigwig Blythe Masters, also used blockchain tech to enable a startup called Pivit to distribute shares to investors. Nasdaq is unfazed by these precedents. “This is the first-ever private securities issuance documented with blockchain technology and we stand by this view,” Nasdaq spokesman Ryan Wells told Quartz.Blockchains promise to cut out a lot of the administrative costs and paperwork that’s currently required when private companies want to distribute shares. That’s because a blockchain is a shared ledger that all the parties in a transaction maintain, which cuts out the need for manual work, like mailing paper-share certificates and updating individual ledgers. That’s why so many firms are experimenting with the technology’s potential to sharply reduce securities settlement times.But there’s a bit more bluster to cut through in Nasdaq’s claim. Chain, the company that sold its shares, is also the technology vendor that helped build the Linq platform. This isn’t mentioned in Nasdaq’s latest release, although it was announced in June. “Chain is a blockchain developer and worked hand-in-hand with Nasdaq as we created the technology,” Wells said.Nasdaq’s blockchain transaction, then, is starting to look more like a technology vendor testing its product and less like a milestone on the road to a financial technology revolution.', 'It\'s been another formative year in the world of bitcoin and the blockchain, and while the price has been subdued over much of the year, other developments in the space have arguably been more intriguing than in any 12-month period previously.We\'ve seen companies come and go, record-setting funding rounds, increased interest in the technology and, sadly, occasional bad actors still stirring negativity into the mix.In this year-end special, we look back at the news stories that made the most impact during 2015.1. Bitstamp Claims $5 Million Lost in Hot Wallet HackThe year got off to a shocking start on 5th January when bitcoin exchange Bitstamp released a statement admitting that it had suffered a major hack and lost ""less than 19,000 BTC"", or about $5.1m at the time.In a statement, Bitstamp said an undisclosed number of wallets had been compromised, and that upon learning of the breach, it had issued warnings to users and moved to suspend operations.A report, supposedly leaked from the exchange, later suggested that six Bitstamp employees had been targeted over some weeks in a phishing attempt that led to the theft. Eventually, the hackers were able to access two servers containing the file for Bitstamp’s hot wallet and it passphrase.Following the attack, the exchange put in place multi-sig wallet access and contracted bitcoin security firm Xapo to handle its cold wallet storage.However, the incident still served to set the tone for what would be a bleak first half of the year for the industry as a whole, particularly for exchanges, which struggled to find revenues amid increased competition and lower-than-expected user adoption.2. Megabank Joins Coinbase\'s Record $75 Million Funding RoundLater in January, wallet and exchange provider Coinbase announced that it had raised $75m as part of a Series C funding round – smashing the previous record for a bitcoin company.Asides from the figures, the backers were equally impressive.The round included a host of impressive first-time bitcoin investors including the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Fortune 500 financial services group USAA, Spanish megabank BBVA and Japanese telcom giant DoCoMo. Former Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit and former Thomson Reuters CEO Tom Glocer also contributed personal investments.Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong suggested at the time that the funding would help shift the mainstream perception of bitcoin during what had so far been a rocky year for the industry.Armstrong told CoinDesk:""I think this just really changes the conversation. There’s smart money out there that is betting big on this and is totally unphased by the whims of the price and what the market is doing. They’re much more concerned about the fundamentals of what’s happening in the network ... and across those metrics, everything is looking great.""While the fundamentals of the network would continue to be debated, Armstrong was on the money with his prediction about funding, with the round serving as the opening salvo for what would be a year marked by a substantial increase in interest from financial incumbents.3. Bitcoin Startup 21 Announces $116 Million All-Star BackingThe Wall Street Journal published a scoop in March, revealing that stealth startup 21 Inc had raised $116m in funding, a figure that served to put Coinbase\'s $75m January round, at least temporarily, in the shade.21 Inc\'s then-CEO Matthew Pauker indicated at the time that Andreessen Horowitz, Data Collective, Khosla Ventures, RRE Ventures and Yuan Capital were among the firms that invested in the company.Qualcomm Ventures also participated, as did Dropbox CEO Drew Houston and Zynga co-founder Mark Pincus.What many missed in all the excitement, however, was that the impressive figure had been raised over multiple funding rounds dating back likely as far as 2013.The news was all the more mysterious since the California-based company was still not yet publicizing its business plans.Observers at the time said chip-maker Qualcomm\'s involvement was a likely sign that mobile technologies could be at the heart of 21\'s endeavour, but the big reveal was to come later in the year.4. Former JP Morgan Exec Blythe Masters Swaps Wall Street for BitcoinMarch brought further interesting news, when former JP Morgan exec Blythe Masters took a chief executive role at bitcoin trading platform Digital Assets Holdings (DA).In a statement to the Wall Street Journal, the commodities veteran suggested that blockchain technology could restore confidence and trust in the financial markets, sentiments that would soon find her becoming the veritable figurehead for the rising interest use cases for bitcoin\'s distributed ledger, the blockchain.Masters, who had previously been head of global commodities at JP Morgan Chase, told the WSJ at the time:""Digital Assets has a revolutionary technology platform that eliminates the counterparty risk and lack of transparency that has hindered mainstream adoption of cryptographic technology. The possibilities for reducing cost and risk in settlement are enormous.""In the months since, Masters has become known for her work promoting blockchain tech to Wall Street execs, and has turned down an offer from Barclays to stay at DA.Still, it was ultimately a mixed year for the DA team, with reports asserting the startup is struggling to raise funding while criticizing the strength of its technical product.5. Former White House Advisor to Head MIT Digital Currency InitiativeApril saw MIT Media Lab announce the launch of Digital Currency Initiative, a three-pronged program aimed at increasing awareness of the technology on campus while providing research to promote policy and standards initiatives.The news was embellished by the fact that it was to be led by former White House senior advisor Brian Forde, who had previously worked with the administration of President Barack Obama.Forde explained at the time how the Digital Currency Initiative would seek to address questions regarding the technology\'s security, scalability and privacy, while convening governments and nonprofits ""to research and test concepts"" related to its use.Soon after, Bitcoin Core developers Gavin Andresen, Wladimir van der Laan and Cory Fields joined the project, at a time when their previous financial supporter, the Bitcoin Foundation, was undergoing financial difficulties.Brian Forde said the move would help bring stability to development team, something he suggested had been lacking in recent years as the foundation had been rocked by scandals.6. Nasdaq Becomes Latest Firm to Trial Blockchain TechnologyLater in April, global stock market giant Nasdaq went public with its explorations into how a blockchain solutions could change the way shares are transferred and sold.While Nasdaq was simply ""the latest"" big financial group to advertise its interest at the time, it would soon become the most prolific in terms of stoking public interest in its blockchain R&D.The company would later reveal it was trialling the technology in Nasdaq Private Market, a capital marketplace launched in January 2014, eventually debuting the proof-of-concept at Money 20/20 in November of that year.In subsequent interviews, Nasdaq has hinted that it is exploring more use cases for the technology and that its interest is only in its infancy.This enthusiasm also appears to be present throughout the organization, with Nasdaq chief executive Robert Greifeld even telling The Wall Street Journal:""Utilising the blockchain is a natural digital evolution for managing physical securities.""7. Silk Road Operator Ross Ulbricht Sentenced to Life in PrisonOn 29th May, Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the operation of Silk Road, the now-defunct online dark market.The sentence was handed down by US District Judge Katherine Forrest in New York, capping roughly a year and a half-long legal process that saw multiple bitcoin auctions and the shock indictment of two federal agents involved in the investigation.In addition to the prison term, Ulbricht was ordered to pay $183.9m to the federal government, an amount tied to proceeds related to the operation of Silk Road.Ulbricht, who ran the marketplace under the name Dread Pirate Roberts, was convicted in February on seven charges related to narcotics distribution, computer hacking and conspiracy.The severity of the sentencing quickly set off a firestorm of comment and criticism, with debates centering on the alleged hypocrisy of the federal government and the morality of its handling of illicit Internet crime in context of its actions against the traditional financial sector.Such criticisms, however, were interspersed with live drama, as standing outside of a New York courthouse, Lyn Ulbricht voiced concern for her son Ross Ulbricht’s safety as he left for a maximum security prison.8. Is Greece Really Behind Bitcoin\'s Latest Price Surge?After months of relative calm, the price of bitcoin spiked to a relative high of $257 on 17th June.Some in the community sought to tie the market movement to the fact that that Greece was, at the time, likely to default on its debt obligations and exit the eurozone (the \'Grexit\' as it had been dubbed).The international press seized on the claims, but were the two actually linked?The narrative was not a new one for the bitcoin space, given that digital currencies are one of the few assets that can act as a hedge against fiat currency fluctuation. Similarly, many in the bitcoin community had correlated the rising interest in bitcoin in 2013 with severe economic issues in Cyprus, past precedent that gave momentum to the theory.However, many prominent members of the bitcoin space had doubts that any real links existed between the two situations, and that Greeks were unlikely to turn to bitcoin as a safe-haven asset.UK Digital Currency Association board member Paul Gordon suggested at the time, while a convenient narrative, there was little evidence to suggest the timing was anything but coincidental or that activity in Greece is actually at the root of the movement.Others startups took advantage of the attention, with firms like Coinbase seeking to advertise their services more intently to Greek users.9. New York Releases Final BitLicenseAfter more than a year of waiting, the bitcoin and blockchain industry finally saw the passage of the first state-specific licensing regime for digital currencies in June.The long-controversial regulation was nonetheless heralded as a major milestone among major financial news outlets, one that precipitated a slew of other important developments.Soon after, bitcoin exchanges itBit and Gemini launched services in New York, though they did so with banking charters rather than BitLicenses. Later, Circle Internet Financial secured what has been to date, the only license issued in the state.Elsewhere, there was a predictable series of events with bitcoin companies pulling out of New York, blaming the costs of compliance.Since then, technology advocates have continued to argue the law was still too restrictive for a nascent industry, prompting other US states to take different paths to regulating the industry.Following its passage, California and North Carolina have both started, and shelved, plans to introduce similar measures.10. Bitcoin \'Forked\' in Controversial Bid to Resolve Scalability QuestionMid-August saw a controversial attempt to resolve the fiery bitcoin scalability debate, when two of bitcoin\'s best-known developers – Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn – \'forked\' a version of the software that helps run the network.The changes to Bitcoin XT (a patch that sits over Bitcoin Core) were written as a way to \'opt out\' of bitcoin\'s 1MB block size limit, which currently limits the number of transactions that can be processed by the digital currency\'s mining network roughly every 10 minutes.Without change, the network can handle around 3-7 transactions per second on a sustained basis, and the average by mid-June had been 1.2 t/s. However, that\'s not to say there wasn\'t impetus for action.Impromptu stress tests had demonstrated that by overloading the network with high numbers of transactions, it was possible to cause significant delays in transaction confirmation.Reaching the so-called \'capacity cliff\' (when transactions exceed the capacity of the network) could either create a competitive market for transaction fees or destroy the robustness of the network completely, depending on who you ask.Increasing bitcoin\'s block size – a \'quick fix\' for the issue – carries its own long-term implications for the network, which some argued would make the network more centralised and, thus, less trusted.While anyone can run XT, the new rules will only be triggered when 75% of bitcoin miners have done so. In effect, it was a novel way to let people actually using and supporting the network vote on the matter.There were numerous critics of the changes, however. Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd, for one, said at the time that the standard 95% threshold for soft-forks was chosen for good safety engineering reasons, and that 75% was ""very low"".Pieter Wuille, another Core developer, told CoinDesk he also had concerns:""People not being able to send coins from one \'side\' of the fork to another, and all coins that existed before the fork being able to be spent twice (once on every side of the fork) [is] the very thing that bitcoin was designed to prevent.""\'Theymos\', moderator of Reddit\'s r/bitcoin forum, even banned talk of XT claiming that as a fork of Bitcoin Core, XT should be classed as an \'altcoin\' or a \'forkcoin\', similar to litecoin.11. Visa, Capital One Back $30 Million Round for Blockchain Startup ChainOn 9th September, startup Chain announced it had raised $30m in new funding from investors including Visa, Capital One and Fiserv – an impressive figure that revealed the growing recognition of the advantages of blockchain technology.French telecom giant Orange SA contributed to the round, as did Nasdaq, which has been working with Chain, and Citi Ventures.The funding all but cemented Chain as the company to watch in the industry, as it had seemingly found a viable business model at a time when many startups were struggling to earn revenues amid declining interest in bitcoin trading.Chain would go on to debut four proofs-of-concept at big-box financial conference Money 20/20, all but stealing the show from its competition.12. Inside R3CEV\'s Plot to Bring Distributed Ledgers to Wall StreetFirst outed by CoinDesk for its ambitions to build a blockchain consortium in July, it was tough at first to tell how successful R3 would be at enlisting enterprise organizations in its work.Was it an R&D workshop? A consultancy? Or would it be offering a product of its own? While R3\'s exact strategy is still a bit unclear, what\'s not is that it will have tremendous support from financial incumbents.The turn of the tide came in mid-September nine major investment banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, partnered with the startup. Many on the list had previously announced independent efforts to study blockchain tech, and the banks were said to be investing money in R3 as part of the effort.Late September saw 13 more banks sign up – including Citi, HSBC and Bank of America Chase – followed by BNP Paribas, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, ING, MacQuarie and Wells Fargo in November, and another 12 in December that included Banco Santander.In total, R3 now says 42 of the world\'s banks have joined the group.13. Amazon Starts Shipping 21 Bitcoin ComputersThe mysterious and extremely well-funded bitcoin startup 21 Inc made an official announcement for its upcoming bitcoin product in May, stating at the time that its market strategy would focus on distributing bitcoin mining chips embedded in consumer and enterprise hardware devices.However, it wasn\'t until late September that it finally started accepting pre-orders for an actual consumer device – the 21 Bitcoin Computer – and 16th November that it actually went on general sale on Amazon.Retailing for $399.99, the 21 Bitcoin Computer includes a custom mining chip, a datacenter backend and a custom Linux-based operating system.The firm made it clear that it did not intend for its units, which contribute to transaction processing on the bitcoin blockchain, to be tools for speculative bitcoin mining. Instead, the units were aimed to provide a ""stream of bitcoins"" for use in apps and services.21 Inc, however, struggled somewhat to communicate the product\'s advantages even to its target consumers in the development community, and as of the end of 2015, seemed intent on relying on word-of-mouth advertising to propel its project rather than more expensive or articulate advertising campaigns.14. Reports Claim Satoshi Nakamoto Might Be 44-Year-Old AustralianReports from Wired and Gizmodo on the 9th December shocked the bitcoin world with claims that they had possibly identified the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, as Australian entrepreneur Craig S Wright.Dave Kleiman, a US computer forensics expert who passed away in 2013, was also said to have been significantly involved in the development of the digital currency.According to Wright\'s LinkedIn account, he has worked with a series of companies including Hotwire Pre-Emptive Intelligence Group – the firm behind an effort to create a bitcoin-based bank called Denariuz and later ran into problems with the Australian Tax Office.In its exposé, Wired cited ""an anonymous source close to Wright"" who provided a cache of emails, transcripts and other documents that pointed to Wright\'s role in the creation of bitcoin.Gizmodo, meanwhile, said it had been provided with a cache of documents, which it had corroborated in interviews, from someone claiming to have hacked Wright’s business email account.Wired presented its evidence with caution, raising the possibility that the information might have been fabricated – perhaps even by Wright himself, and other news outlets soon began picking apart the story\'s inconsistencies.Still, the idea that the Wright \'revelations\' are nothing but a hoax has been aired by other observers, though the compelling nature of the published evidence will no doubt fuel speculation for some time to come.What were your biggest stories of 2015?

In 2014, The Guardian reported that America is ‘a decade behind Europe’ in terms of adopting the chip and pin cards that have reduced data theft, due to the former’s strict regulatory rules. Today, European countries, especially the Netherlands, are keen to adopt the latest fintech.In this post, we want to highlight the latest payment and financial technologies implemented by banks and businesses in the Netherlands.Contact and contactless machinesAccording to the information shared by Worldpay, countertop payment terminals remain the ‘most widely used payment method’ by most businesses and retailers worldwide. These machines are also able to accept contactless payments that reduce customer waiting time as well as process requests faster and more secure.Apart from the countertop machines, here are the other kinds of card machines that businesses leverage:1. Portable card machines2. Mobile card machines3. Contactless paymentsBitcoin and cryptocurrenciesIn June 2015, Cryptocoinnews reported about International Monetary Fund (IMF) Director Christine Lagarde’s thoughts on Bitcoin and its groundbreaking technology. Lagarde said that banks and financial institutions shouldn’t worry about Bitcoin, Blockchain, and other cryptocurrencies – rather they should challenge them to strengthen their security processes, to offer people the most secure and fastest peer-to-peer currency exchange. Three Dutch banks (ING, ABN Amro, and Rabobank) have already announced that they are experimenting with Bitcoin and its technology as a way to improve their payment systems. But, many banks and financial organizations remain cautious when it comes to accepting the cryptocurreny as issues regarding its security remain a hotly debated topic.Voice-activated online bankingWe all know what Siri can do, but now a Dutch bank has announced their latest innovation for online banking that allows users to access their digital bank accounts through voice activation. ING Netherlands released their new mobile banking app that comes with voice-activated log-in to fight banking fraud. In a featured post from the Daily Mail, the same application will also have an option to use the fingerprint recognition (Touch ID) on Apple devices.“Thanks in part to the inclusion of biometric applications, we are able to make banking faster, smoother and easier for our customers and improve access,” said ING internet & mobile marketing manager Jeroen Losekoot. “This allows them to have greater control over their finances.”The Netherlands remains one of the top adopters of financial technologies, not only in Europe but also across the world. New fintech innovations are set to initiate huge developments in the financial industry. What other financial technologies do you expect to see next year?Photo Credit: antanacoins via Compfight cc', 'Trögt i porten för insektsmatInsekter må vara framtidens föda – men de är fortfarande sällsynta på tallrikarna. Sedan vi skrev om saken i våras har myndigheterna stängt två nätbutiker, varav en i Göteborg.Det har talats mycket om insekter som proteinkälla, inte minst sedan FN-rapport 2013 pekade ut dem som en lösning på hungerproblemen. Men det är fortfarande förbjudet att sälja insekter som människoföda i Sverige och de flesta EU-länder.På sensommaren stoppade miljöförvaltningen i Göteborg firman Hakuna mat, som sålde bland annat mjölmask och gräshoppor. En planerad provsmakning vid Malmöfestivalen ställdes också in. Någon månad senare tvingades företaget Qvicket i Stockholm sluta sälja mjöl och knäckebröd tillverkade av malda syrsor.Nya regler kan vara på väg, säger Zofia Kurowska, statsinspektör vid Livsmedelsverket.- Det som har hänt senast är att Efsa (EU:s livsmedelsmyndighet) har kommit med en riskprofil om insekter. De har rett ut vilka risker som finns när det gäller till exempel allergier, hygien och miljö. Sedan följer vi noga ett ärende i Frankrike där ett företag kommer att ansöka om att få producera sådan mat.Här i Sverige har ovan nämnda Qvicket sökt tillstånd att få sälja sina insektsvaror. Beslutet ser dock ut att dröja.- Vi behöver nya riktlinjer från Efsa, de kan komma nästa sommar. Vår uppgift är att konsumenterna ska få säker mat. Vi godkänner inte någonting förhastat, säger Zofia Kurowska.Dryga böter hotar tandborstbolagMyndigheterna tar i med hårdhandskarna mot INT förbrukningsartiklar, det lilla företaget i Jönköping som har varit en av årets värsta konsumentplågor. Nu hotar mångmiljonböter.Firman drivs av en 24-årig man i Jönköping som säljer tandborstar under namnet Dental clean och nyckelbrickor under namnet Nyckelhittaren Jönköping. Vi skrev om honom i augusti – hans då helt nystartade verksamhet toppade listan över sommarens mest KO-anmälda bolag.Sedan dess har klagomålen fortsatt. Ett stort antal kunder berättar om falska löften och räkningar som anlänt utan att de beställt något, ibland utan att de ens talat med företaget. Firman har fått 106 KO-anmälningar samt minst 120 polisanmälningar sedan i juni.I november stämde Konsumentombudsmannen bolaget i tingsrätten. I december kom ett interimistiskt beslut, där INT förbrukningsartiklar och dess ägare förbjuds att vilseleda kunderna vid vite av upp till fyra miljoner kronor per vecka. Bolaget åläggs att informera om säljsamtalens syfte, om att deras ""gratiserbjudanden"" är kopplade till abonnemang samt om ångerrätten. Dessutom måste de genast sluta skicka ut obeställda varor.- Så kallade löpande viten är något som vi yrkar vid de grövsta överträdelserna, företag som fortsätter med otillbörliga metoder trots tidigare uppmaningar, säger Gunnar Wikström som är processråd hos KO.Samtidigt utreds polisanmälningarna av bedrägeriroteln i Jönköping. Det är ännu oklart om 24-åringen kommer att åtalas.- Det är dumheter han håller på med. Människor har blivit lurade. Frågan är om det går att styrka brottsligt uppsåt, säger förundersökningsledaren Niclas Abrahamsson.24-åringen har tidigare skyllt överträdelserna på sina före detta anställda och har uppgivit att företaget ""växte för fort"". När konsumentredaktionen ringde upp honom höstas lade han på luren.Inga spår efter Iphone-skojarenI augusti betalade den 37-årige göteborgaren Markus 4 500 kronor för en Iphone 6 som visade sig vara en plastkopia. Polisen har inte hittat bedragaren.- Det har inte hänt något. Polisen verkar inte komma någon vart, säger han.Bluffen var grundligt genomförd med Blocket-annons, förfalskat kvitto, inplastad kartong och falskt IMEI-nummer (mobilens unika id-nummer). För Markus sved det extra mycket eftersom telefonen var en 60-årspresent till hans mamma.- Besvikelsen lagt sig men den finns kvar. Jag försöker att inte tänka på det. Jag lärde mig en läxa men den var inte billig, säger han.Denna sorts bedrägerier har varit vanliga under året. Polisens råd är att helst inte köpa mobiler privat och, om man ändå gör det, att bryta förpackningen på plats och kontrollera produkten.I oktober dömdes en 23-årig Malmöbo för mer än 50 Iphone-bedrägerier runt om i Sverige, bland annat i Göteborg, Kungälv och Halmstad. Tillvägagångssättet var till stora delar likadant men 23-åringen har inte kunnat kopplas till bedrägeriet mot Markus.Nya stämningar mot bitcoinbolagKunderna som känner sig lurade av bitcoinbolaget KNC miner fick inget stöd av Allmänna reklamationsnämnden. Nu väntar rättegång.Företaget sålde dyra specialdatorer (cirka 80 000 kronor styck) som skulle användas för att utvinna bitcoin och andra digitala valutor. Maskinerna blev kraftigt försenade, ibland var de trasiga eller kom aldrig överhuvudtaget. KNC Miner vägrade ersätta kunderna.Ett 40-tal personer vände sig till ARN. Nu har nämnden avvisat anmälningarna – inte för att bolaget gjorde rätt, utan för att den som utvinner bitcoin räknas som företagare och därför inte kan få sin tvist prövad hos ARN.En av anmälarna är en 31-årig göteborgare som vi intervjuade i våras. Han betalade 81 000 kronor för en maskin som kom en och en halv månad efter utlovad tid. 31-åringen ville häva köpet, dels på grund av förseningen och dels för att flera likadana maskiner börjat brinna.- Beskedet från ARN överraskade mig. Jag trodde det skulle bli ett annat beslut. Jag har inte bestämt hur jag ska gå vidare, säger han i dag.Samtidigt har 54 personer stämt företaget i tingsrätten för att få sina pengar tillbaka. Antalet kommer att öka, uppger deras advokat Magnus Daar.- Inom kort lämnar vi in en ny grupptalan mot KNC Miner med ett 50-tal svenska och utländska deltagare.Företagets vd Sam Cole hävdar i ett mejl till konsumentredaktionen att ""vi har uppfyllt vad vi lovat i fråga om leveranstider"" och att ""vissa av våra kunder har varit ute efter att göra snabba klipp"". Han förnekar att datorerna skulle vara brandfarliga.KNC Miner säljer inte längre datorer men driver en serverhall i Boden. Bolaget gick med stor förlust under andra halvåret 2014; resultatet var minus 66 miljoner kronor på en omsättning av 194 miljoner.', 'DECENT is an autonomous decentralized system owned by its users. The DECENT platform allows media sharing by guaranteeing to its users the right to freely express themselves. Matej Michalko, the Startup’s Co-founder and CEO says the company’s end goal is to give access to borderless data and information streams while maintaining a strategic distance from control, restriction or any outsider impact.DECENT created a distributed and secure publishing platform to allow users to freely and anonymously share their content while being able to monetize it. DECENT is liberating the world of media by enabling decentralized sharing of digital content. The project’s aim is to eliminate all political and geographical barriers so that people around the world can freely express themselves without any restrictions.The DECENT platform is anonymous; all the players are identified exclusively by their ID and protected by advanced cryptography. However, the users also have the option to be associated with given content. Focused on freedom of speech and expression, the platform provides unlimited access to information for everyone in the world.DECENT provides open-source software that enables users to share unlimited virtual content; the company’s main goal is to give a chance to individuals whose voice is normally controlled. DECENT combines a micropayment framework with solid encryption, giving a whole new level of privacy to its users—the DECENT platform only allows for authorized users to access the content. The platform operates via a P2P network, and DECENT’s platform is not centrally hosted, so the data cannot be manipulated and they can never be blocked.NewsBTC had a meeting with Matej Michalko, one of the company’s co-founders and CEO, where he was more than happy to tell us all about DECENT.NewsBTC – DECENT is introducing a new decentralized and anonymous P2P platform that allows users to freely share their content without any restrictions. What can you tell us about DECENT, and how did you come up with the idea for this new Platform?Matej – I’ve been familiar with Bitcoin since 2012. I have been a miner since 2012 and have organized bitcoin and cryptocurrency conferences all over the world. I’m the founder of BitcoinExpo and Bitcoin 2 Business Congress series, that had its chapters twice in London, Vienna, Shanghai, and Brussels. I also founded the first Crypto Digital Marketing Agency – BitcoinMarkerting in the world helping new cryptocurrency companies to get to the market.Hence, I understand the immense potential the Blockchain technology has; it can be applied to many different domains. I also observed that the world of media is dominated by oligopolies of big players and that there is a lack of free publishing platforms that would transform the current market dominated by oligopolies into a perfectly competitive one. Currently, the biggest players on the market charge about 60% for e-book distribution.The poor writers have only about 40% of the amount their readers pay. For instance, if they sell 10,000 books worth $20 each, they get only $80,000 instead of the $200,000 they could have when publishing with DECENT. There was a market need for a free P2P digital content distribution platform: all for the benefits of authors (writers, bloggers, musicians, video makers, …) and content consumers (readers, listeners, viewers, …).NewsBTC – What can you tell us about the DECENT team?Matej – I co-founded DECENT with Matej Boda, who was cooperating with me on the BitcoinExpo series. Moreover, our team consists of ex-Ericsson architect Josef Sevcik and well-known blockchain cryptographer Pavel Kravchenko. Our online presence is secured thanks to Martin Polacek and Sandra Wantrubova, and our Europe office is up and running thanks to Jana P. Bodova. We have secured a decent presence in China, mainly thanks to Xiaomin Wang and Weiwu Zhang.NewsBTC – What can you tell us about the company roadmap, aims and goals?Matej – The DECENT Protocol is developed and maintained by a Swiss-based foundation. The roadmap for 2016 is the following:We are planning a crowdsale of DECENT in Q1 2016 for the financing of the development and initial distribution of DCT tokens that will power the network.So far, there is a prototype with an API and a proof of concept available, that will be described soon in a video published at DECENT. Besides developing DECENT’s core, we are planning to make a lot of updates including security fixes and many other developments.NewsBTC – Can you tell us all about the platform, and how does it work?Matej – DECENT was designed with principles of functional decomposition. We have developed three independent layers, each serving specific functions:The data distribution layer, which is used for storing and sharing huge amounts of user-generated content. The blockchain, where all the transactions and contracts happen in a publicly verifiable manner. Also, the blockchain is used for storing permanent data. Those are buying transactions, publishing transactions, ratings, etc.And the recommendation layer, which consists of a set of independent recommendation engines, helping the consumer to select the most relevant content. From a user’s perspective, there are three roles the user can have:The Author—the author creates new content and publishes it on the network.The Content Consumer—the Content Consumer reads, watches, listens or otherwise consumes the content created by the authors.The Publisher and Miner. The publisher plays a vital role in the network: the publisher stores the content created by the author and distributes it to the consumers. The miner verifies the transactions and realizes payment distribution, and therefore is responsible for the consistency of the network.The interaction and flow principles are as follows:Authors can set the price for the content. Only users who paid the price set by the author can access the content. On the other hand, the payment will be processed only if the user verifiably received the content.The Author pays the Publisher for acting as a storage and content distribution network. The payment will be released over time to motivate the publisher to keep the content as long as required. The payment for network storage is also an effective anti-spam mechanism.Consumers can rate the content. These ratings can be used for various purposes, e.g. assuming content quality, author’s reputation or by recommendation engines. 100% of the payment for the content goes to the author. There are no network or processing fees. The Author and Consumer can remain fully anonymous if they want to.NewsBTC – Do you have any partnerships?Matej – We have partnerships with a few corporations that are going to build their own platforms or integrate it into their existing services, but I can’t disclose that information for now!NewsBTC – Can you comment about the company’s investors or what type of investors DECENT was able to find?Matej – We had: US/Chinese/Malaysian VC funds (seed investment); they invest into blockchain-based applications as they believe this will be the future of the world. The blockchain will replace many services that work well today—remember, Uber is a middleman. They take 20% fees.NewsBTC – How do you see or what is your vision about BTC and the blockchain’s significance to freedom of speech?Matej – The blockchain is decentralized trust. Most of the people need some sort of a third party to refer to, such as their grocery, transporter, the one they work for, etc. Since the early days, centralization has been a major competitive advantage: the media has been controlled and manipulated by monopolies and oligopolies that pushed the market advantage to make profits in detriment of authors and readers.The advent of the internet did not help much to get rid of centralization in order to move to more competitive markets; the blockchain meant a revolution in this paradigm. For the first time, people are able to use a fully competitive market for digital content, where 100% of the revenue paid by readers goes to the authors in order to put money where it should be on behalf of everyone but greedy monopolists and oligopolists.NewsBTC – What are your prospects and expectations for the future of the DECENT platform?Matej – We are hoping that within five years we will become the main publishing protocol worldwide. Get more developers and integrating into more existing content distribution protocol and platforms. Save time, money and create new, better, fully competitive markets.NewsBTC – What are your expectations for the future of Bitcoin and digital currencies?Matej – I believe that more and more services are going to be replaced by blockchain-based ones, such as notary public, money transfers, e-governments, etc. I believe both Bitcoin and blockchain technology have a bright future ahead.You can watch a description in the official DECENT video:']"
